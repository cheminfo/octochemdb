<heading level="2" id="h-0002">FIELD OF INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002"> This invention relates to a wearable garment capable of providing passive ventilation to a wearer such as when worn under an over-garment such as body armor. In at least one embodiment, the invention relates to a vest-type garment constructed from a three-dimensional, flexible honeycomb-like configured material. In at least one preferred embodiment, this invention relates to a garment having a predetermined thickness and memory thereof such that the garment is capable of maintaining an over-garment at a selected spatial distance from the body of the wearer. </p>
<heading level="2" id="h-0003">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003"> Due to its effectiveness, use of body armor by military and law enforcement personnel has become increasingly common during recent years. In some cases, for example, body armor is part of the standard issue uniform and its use by law enforcement and military personnel may, in fact, be required in some circumstances. Although the use of such equipment provides important safety benefits, principally protection from gunfire, conventional body armor (e.g., bulletproof vests) are heavy and constructed from thick, non-breathable materials which are uncomfortable and/or do not allow the wearer's body to cool itself naturally (due to the inhibition of evaporation of perspiration). Compounding this problem it has been common in recent years for U.S. soldiers to be deployed to countries with high average temperatures and/or humidity (e.g., Afghanistan, Iraq). In such climates, the use of conventional body armor, combined with the wearing of backpacks and other equipment, subjects soldiers to risks related to high body temperatures such as heat exhaustion and/or heat casualties (in addition to simply being uncomfortable). As a result, despite the obvious safety benefits of body armor, it is not uncommon for a soldier or law enforcement officer, lulled into a false sense of security, to simply not wear the body armor at all in some scenarios. This, in turn, puts the soldier or police officer, for example, in substantial danger should ballistic-type conflict be encountered. </p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004"> In view of the above issues related to convention body armor, it would be advantageous if there were available a garment which could be worn in combination with body armor, which would decrease discomfort levels as well as aid in cooling the body for safety reasons. Addressing related problems in the art, various patents, such as U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,515,543; 5,925,441; 6,473,910 and 6,526,862, have attempted to provide a garment which provides some measure of cooling or ventilation to the wearer. Nevertheless, known garments which have attempted to address such needs (such as described in the above-listed patents or otherwise), typically employ some mechanism to actively pump air to and from chambers of a garment, for example. For example, in order to provide active circulation or pumping functions, some prior art garments utilize a fan and associated power supply and, therefore, are more expensive and complicated to manufacture, as well as susceptible to failure during field use. Furthermore, such active-type garments, because of the components they employ, add significant weight which is extremely disadvantageous to a soldier, in particular, because of their already heavy pack loads. Known passive-type (i.e., non-power operated) garments, conversely, have typically utilized sealed air chambers through which no air circulation can take place or limit passive air circulation due to other structural drawbacks. </p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005"> In view of such issues related to cost, weight and reliability, it is contemplated that there is a need for a garment which does not suffer such drawbacks, but which when worn under body armor provides safety and comfort to the user. </p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"> In view of the above enumerated drawbacks, it is apparent that there exists a need in the art for apparatus and/or methods which solve and/or ameliorate at least one of the above problems. It is a purpose of this invention to fulfill these needs in the art as well as other needs that will become more apparent to the skilled artisan once given the following disclosure. </p>
<heading level="2" id="h-0004">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007"> Generally speaking, this invention fulfills the above-described needs in the art by providing: </p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008"> A wearable garment capable of effecting passive ventilation when worn under an over-garment, said wearable garment comprising: </p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009"> a sheet of three-dimensional fabric configured as a torso covering garment, said sheet of three-dimensional fabric being constructed as a combination of layers including a top layer, a bottom layer, and a middle layer located in between and connecting said top and bottom layers; </p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010"> wherein said top, bottom, and middle layers each include a plurality of openings interconnected with openings in adjacent layers, said interconnection of openings thereby forming a plurality of air pathways interwoven throughout said wearable garment and through which air passively travels; and </p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011"> wherein at least said middle layer is comprised of a plurality of elements spatially separating and extending between said top and bottom layers, said elements having semi-rigid, semi-flexible characteristics. </p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012"> In at least one embodiment, passive air flow is possible through the garment in at least two dimensions of space, but more preferably, in three dimensions thereof. In such an embodiment or embodiments, the openings in the top and bottom layers extend between the top and bottom layers and may be joined to openings extending perpendicularly (or extending at some other angle or combination of angles predetermined or random) thereto. Such embodiments exhibit excellent passive air flow properties. </p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013"> In at least one further embodiment, the garment is substantially flexible such that it can be folded for storage or packing and/or so that it is comfortable to the wearer. </p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014"> In a still further embodiment, the middle portion elements have a memory such that if they are compressed by a force, the middle portion elements will return substantially to their original configuration when the force is removed. In some embodiments, this memory helps maintain the spacing between the top and bottom layers during extended use. </p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015"> In yet further alternative embodiments, the three-dimensional fabric or a portion thereof may be flame resistant or retardant or may offer protection from projectiles (alone or in combination with armor, for example) and/or may be melt resistant. </p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016"> In yet still further preferred embodiments, the wearable garment is configured in the form of a vest. In such embodiments, the vest may be manufactured (cut or formed) from a single piece of three-dimensional material. In other embodiments, the vest may be constructed from two or more separate pieces or cuts of material joined together by one or more of various means (conventional or otherwise). Moreover, when worn, the vest may be joined at the sides (loosely or securely as desired) via elastic straps, Velcro, plastic clips, Hypalon&#xae; or rubber-type fasteners, sewing, or any combination of the above, or via any combination of alternative connectors. Preferred embodiments of vest closure mechanisms (connectors) are illustrated in the drawings that accompany this application. </p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017"> Although, in some embodiments, it is preferred that the utilized connectors be adjustable in order to adjust the vest size to individual users, in at least one embodiment, a one-size-fits-all design is contemplated. </p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018"> In further embodiments which may or may not employ connectors depending on design considerations, the garment may be integrally connected (e.g. sewn) to the body facing side of an over-garment to provide passive ventilation under the over-garment. In similar embodiments, the garment may be integrally connected, such as sewn, to the non-body facing side of an undergarment (for providing ventilation over the undergarment when an over-garment is worn thereover). </p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019"> In particularly preferred embodiments, the garment has a predetermined thickness (with or without a memory) so that the garment is capable of thereby spacing an over-garment at a selected distance from the body of the wearer. In a preferred embodiment, the predetermined thickness is between &#x215b; and &#xbd; inch. In a more preferred embodiment, the predetermined thickness is approximately &#xbc; to &#xbd; inch. In a still more preferred embodiment, the predetermined thickness is approximately 6/8 inch +/&#x2212; approximately 10%. </p>

<heading level="2" id="h-0006">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF CERTAIN EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"> For a more complete understanding of the present invention and advantages thereof, reference is now made to the following description of various illustrative and non-limiting embodiments thereof, taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings submitted herewith. </p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"> Referring initially now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, therein is illustrated ventilation garment <b>1</b> as one exemplar embodiment of the subject invention. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, garment <b>1</b> generally comprises a quantity of three-dimensional fabric <b>3</b> configured in the shape of a wearable vest. In this regard, garment <b>1</b> includes a neck aperture <b>23</b> as well as two opposing arm apertures <b>25</b><i>a </i>and <b>25</b><i>b. </i>Additionally, garment <b>1</b> includes a set of fasteners <b>27</b> for securing garment <b>1</b> to a user as well as for adjusting the fit of the garment according to various body sizes. </p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"> Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, an example of a specific three-dimensional configuration of fabric <b>3</b> can be seen therein. Specifically, as seen most clearly in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, fabric <b>3</b> includes a top layer <b>5</b>, a bottom layer <b>7</b>, and a middle layer <b>9</b> sandwiched between the top and bottom layers. Additionally, fabric <b>3</b> includes a plurality of spaced apart vertically oriented openings <b>29</b> as well as a plurality of randomly spaced apart non-vertically oriented openings <b>31</b>. (It is noted that the terms related to orientations used herein, e.g., &#x201c;vertically&#x201d; are only used in reference to the orientations as they are illustrated in specific figures. They are not intended to describe any orientations as will be experienced in field use.) These apertures or openings <b>29</b> and <b>31</b>, in particular, allow passive air flow through a plurality of air passageways &#x201c;a&#x201d; disposed throughout the generally honeycomb-like structure. </p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"> In preferred embodiments as can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, middle layer <b>9</b> comprises a plurality of randomly oriented flexible elements <b>13</b> which is characterized by having resilient properties and which are capable of substantially maintaining a desired spatial relationship between top layer <b>5</b> and bottom layer <b>7</b>. Maintaining such a relationship is important, in this regard, because when such a spatial relationship is preserved, passive air flow through the various air passageways &#x201c;a&#x201d; is substantially optimized (thus providing excellent ventilation properties to the vest). In more preferred embodiments, the specific degree of resilience (e.g., combination of flexibleness and stiffness) of elements <b>13</b> is specifically chosen to accomplish various goals. For example, in at least one embodiment of the subject invention, elements <b>13</b> are constructed of a material that provides a cushioning barrier between layers <b>5</b> and <b>7</b>. When designed as such, when body armor, for example, is worn over garment <b>1</b>, the subjective comfort level of the armor is substantially increased as compared to if the body armor was worn alone, i.e., without a cushioning undergarment. </p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"> In addition to choosing a material for elements <b>13</b> that provides such cushioning characteristics, the material or combinations thereof (e.g., polyesters) chosen to construct elements <b>13</b> can be additionally selected so that the elements possess a &#x201c;memory&#x201d;. In this regard, the term &#x201c;memory&#x201d;, for the purposes of construing the specification and claims, is intended to indicate the tendency or ability of the middle layer of fabric <b>3</b> to spring-back to its (substantially) original shape or configuration when such shape or configuration is modified (e.g., compressed) by an external force. More specifically, &#x201c;memory&#x201d;, as it relates to elements <b>13</b>, is principally related to the ability (or least tendency) of elements <b>13</b>, as comprising middle layer <b>9</b>, to maintain the spaced apart relationship between top layer <b>5</b> and bottom layer <b>7</b>. In this manner, passive airflow capabilities are not substantially compromised when a compressive force is applied to garment <b>1</b> because, for example, after the compressive force is removed or lessened, the garment will &#x201c;seek to&#x201d; return to its original thickness and/or configuration. Of course, if a force greater than a specific threshold force is maintained against a surface of fabric <b>3</b>, the fabric will remain compressed until such force is removed. During such interim period, the ability of passive air exchange to happen between various air passageways &#x201c;a&#x201d;, e.g., through and between apertures <b>29</b> and <b>31</b> and the surrounding ambient atmosphere may be compromised. </p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"> Although in order to accomplish one or more of the objectives of the invention, no specific thickness of garment <b>1</b> (and hence fabric <b>3</b>) is required, certain exemplar thicknesses have proven subjectively and objectively effective in field testing and are, therefore, utilized in preferred embodiments. In some cases, these exemplar thicknesses have been chosen as effective primarily because of their ability to adequately space a body armor garment from the body of a wearer (e.g., for proper ventilation). In this regard, it is generally desirable to maintain a user-body to body armor distance between approximately &#x215b; inch and &#xbd; inch (e.g., when not under load), and preferably between approximately &#xbc; inch and 6/8 inch. </p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"> With regard to the above descriptions of desirable fabric characteristics, although it is preferable that garment <b>1</b> have both flexible or resilient characteristics while also possessing at least a partial &#x201c;memory&#x201d; (at least as to thickness), neither of these features is required, and one feature may, of course, be adopted without utilizing the other. </p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"> Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a specific, example application in which garment <b>1</b> finds utility is illustrated in detail therein. In this regard, garment <b>1</b> is shown being worn by a military or law enforcement-type personnel <b>101</b> under a body armor vest <b>103</b> (e.g., for ballistic-type protection). Importantly, as can be seen clearly in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, garment <b>1</b> is specifically sized so that a pre-selected length of material &#x201c;d&#x201d; extends outwardly beyond the boundaries of body armor <b>103</b> so that portions of fabric <b>3</b> are in unobstructed contact with the ambient atmosphere. This, in turn, ensures that maximum passive air flow is permitted between the surrounding atmosphere and the air passageways of garment <b>1</b>. In particularly preferred embodiments (such as shown), in order to maximize the airflow through the passageways defined by apertures <b>29</b> and <b>31</b>, garment <b>1</b> is specifically sized so that substantially the entire outline or perimeter (i.e., the fabric edges) of the garment remains exposed to the surrounding atmosphere, i.e., is not enclosed or otherwise covered or obstructed by body armor <b>103</b>. Nevertheless, it is certainly contemplated that, in some embodiments, garment <b>1</b> will have different sizes and configurations in which portions of its perimeter or outline are obstructed or covered by body armor <b>103</b> or some other garment, for example. Notwithstanding such embodiments, even if a substantial majority portion of the perimeter or outline of garment <b>1</b> is obstructed by a secondary garment (e.g., body armor), improved ventilation as well as overall comfort is achieved (e.g., because of the cushioning feature) such as when compared to not utilizing a garment, such as described herein, at all. </p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"> While still now referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a particularly effective length &#x201c;d&#x201d; for achieving excellent passive ventilation is illustrated therein (not to scale). In this regard, in the instant example, the illustrated length &#x201c;d&#x201d; is selected to be approximately one inch. However, as aforementioned above, various alternative lengths can be selected (by selecting larger or smaller garment sizes) and certainly such exposed lengths &#x201c;d&#x201d; will naturally vary upon movement or shifting of garment <b>1</b>, e.g., due to the disturbance of the garment and body armor during normal &#x201c;field&#x201d; activities. Utilizing approximately &#xbd; to 3 inches of fabric length &#x201c;d&#x201d; as such, exemplar air pathways &#x201c;a&#x201d; are obtained (such as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>), such pathways exemplifying the bidirectional movement of air into and out of the various apertures of garment <b>1</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"> Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a particularly preferred configuration of garment <b>1</b> is illustrated therein which has proven efficient to manufacture as well as demonstrated desirable performance characteristics when used in the field. In this regard, as can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a single rectangular sheet of fabric <b>3</b> lying flat can be die-cut to form neck aperture <b>23</b> as well as arm cutouts <b>25</b><i>a </i>and <b>25</b><i>b </i>(or cut by any other mechanism or method, conventional or otherwise). Employing such a manufacturing method, the manufacturing process for garment <b>1</b> is reduced to a single, simple cutting or trimming step in which a sheet or roll of fabric (e.g., fabric <b>3</b>) is simply fed through appropriately configured cutting machinery for, preferably simultaneously, cutting the centrally located neck hole as well as the two scalloped arm cutouts. Afterwards, fasteners <b>27</b> are connected to the various side or edge portions of fabric <b>3</b> (with conventional sewing methods), each pair of fasteners <b>27</b> being located opposite another pair e.g., one pair having a male type connector and the opposite pair having a female type connector (or some other combination thereof). For achieving the various objectives or combinations thereof as described herein, a variety of connector types are contemplated as useful with the present invention. Illustrative examples of such connectors are Velcro&#xae;-type closures, elastic straps, plastic male/female-type fastening clips, Hypalon&#xae; or rubber-type fasteners, or any combination of the above, or via any combination of alternative connectors. In preferred embodiments of the invention, using connectors as described, garment <b>1</b> can be joined at the respective sides of a user employing fasteners <b>27</b> (loosely or securely as desired) with no further steps required for the garments assembly. </p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"> Utilizing a garment configuration such as described above, garment <b>1</b> can be easily added to the uniform of a user by simply placing neck aperture <b>23</b> over the head of user <b>101</b> with the remaining material then covering the chest and back portions of the user. Thereafter, opposing fasteners <b>27</b> are fastened one to another and body armor <b>103</b> can be pulled thereover. </p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"> Once given the above disclosure, many other features, modifications, and improvements will become apparent to the skilled artisan. Such other features, modifications, and improvements are therefore considered to be part of this invention, the scope of which is to be determined by the following claims: </p>

<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A wetsuit comprised of one-side laminated or the so-called skin panels of rubber sponges, sealed with a new sealant instead of normal stitching. The sealant can be solid or liquid depending on the material that will be sealed such as two cut panels sealed completely and without stitching. The new sealant structure, on opposing faces, enhances seam strength of the one-sided laminated wetsuit and can obviate blind-stitch and flat-stitch (or cover-stitch) on all seams assembled whether it's a one-sided or two-sided stitch. The normal blind-stitch or flat-stitch generates the needle holes that make the wetsuit end-users cold when the wetsuit is wet. The sewing thread also reduces both the flexibility and stretch of the wetsuit. The removal of stitches and the new sealant application make the wetsuit more watertight and flexible and improve aesthetics. The new sealant can be used on laminated rubber sponge wetsuit materials as well. </p>

<heading level="2" id="h-0002">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002"> 1. Field of the Invention </p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003"> The present invention relates generally to the field of wetsuits used for diving, surfing and the like and more specifically to an improved wetsuit comprised of one-sided laminated or the so-called skin panels or rubber sponges, sealed with a sealant instead of the normal stitching. The sealant can be solid or liquid depending on the material that will be sealed, such as two cut panels sealed completely and without stitching. </p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004"> 2. Background Art </p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005"> The conventional methods are at least one-sided stitches on the one-sided laminated or the so-called skin panels of the rubber sponges or they are non-stitch but it's limited to both-side laminated cut panels. Wetsuit end-users are not satisfied with the conventional wetsuits since penetrated needle holes bring in cold water or limited stretchability caused by the sewing threads. The wetsuit market uses a lot of stretchy fabric on the cut panels. Due to non-applicable or not strong sealant on the skin face, all wetsuits have to blind-stitch or flat-stitch on the laminated face. Though conventional wetsuits can be non-stitched, they are all double-sided lamination. The laminated fabric made of nylon or polyester always absorbs the water and makes the wearer cold and the wetsuit dries slowly when it's wet. The skin panels or non-laminated face does not absorb the water like the laminated face. </p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"> The new sealant and non-stitched wetsuits or the present invention can satisfy the professional end-users' demands for overcoming these deficiencies. </p>
<heading level="2" id="h-0003">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007"> The base materials used in the invention are polyurethane and chloroprene, which are known as the materials with highest elasticity and bind with the skin panel to form the necessary strength of connection. </p>
<p id="h-0004" num="0000"> Watertight </p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008"> The new sealant obviates the defects caused by stitching methods, namely penetrating sponge or fabric which causes leaks. When the new sealant is applied on both sides, one side is non-laminated and the other side is laminated or both sides are laminated, the watertight characteristics of the wetsuit are preserved. </p>
<p id="h-0005" num="0000"> High Elasticity </p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009"> The normal used stitching method typically reduces the elasticity of the stitched sponges, even if the sponges are high elasticity or laminated with high elasticity fabric. The elasticity decrease is caused by the threads used in stitching and made of polyester or nylon and the stitching structure is blind-stitch or flat-lock. The present invention seals the wetsuits seams completely without stitching and allows the finished products to maintain the original elasticity of sponge and fabric without any reduction. </p>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000"> Aesthetic Design </p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010"> For the additional aesthetic purposes, the width 5&#x2dc;15 mm, and thickness 0.4&#x2dc;1.5 mm, and the color of the sealant can be adjusted depending upon the objects to be sealed. </p>

<heading level="2" id="h-0001">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001"> This invention relates generally to a device for UV (ultra-violet light) protection while tanning and, more particularly, to a device for UV protection that is configured to protect the face. </p>
<heading level="2" id="h-0002">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002"> The indoor tanning business has become increasingly popular with people wishing to tan their skin to enhance their appearance. Indoor tanning appeals both to people who do not live in a climate that permits the desired amount of sun and to people that do not have adequate time for traditional sun tanning. In this regard, tanning beds, and particularly the more modem tanning beds, allow for maximizing tanning potential in a reduced amount of time. Traditionally, tanning beds enable a user to receive approximately a day's worth of tanning in thirty to forty minutes. Currently, modem (high powered) tanning beds are enabling an approximately equivalent amount of tanning (i.e., ultra-violet light exposure) in five to eight minutes. </p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003"> It is well known that the heat and ultraviolet rays generated by tanning beds may potentially cause damage to the skin of the tanning patron if proper precautions are not taken. These concerns are only increasing with the increased use of modern (high-powered) tanning beds. As such, indoor tanning patrons are often looking for ways to moderate the risks associated with tanning while still maintaining the desired tanning benefits. </p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004"> Unfortunately, tanning has several undesirable consequences. One such consequence is the potential for overexposing sensitive areas on the body to high amounts of ultraviolet light. Such areas include the face, ears, and neck, which may be particularly vulnerable to high amounts of ultraviolet light due their shape and the nature of the skin tissue in that area. </p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005"> Another such consequence is the potentially unsanitary nature, for both the current and subsequent users, of lying on tanning beds that have been repeatedly used by numerous individuals. In this regard, the use of sunscreen lotions for protection from ultraviolet light can be undesirable due to their generally sticky nature, as well as their tendency to attract dirt and grime. Typically, most sunscreen lotions are messy, clog a user's pores, and leave a user's body feeling oily. </p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"> Another undesirable option that is often selected by indoor tanning patrons is to cover their face with a small towel, typically a white terry cloth towel. A terry cloth towel provides very little ultraviolet protection for the indoor tanning studio patron, and particularly for the face and neck region of such a patron. Such towels can also be questionable in terms of hygiene since the tanning bed patron usually does not have first-hand knowledge of the cleanliness of a towel that been supplied to him or her. </p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007"> Accordingly, a protective device is sought after that is simple, sanitary, and will not leave an undesirable amount of tan lines, but will provide the desired amount of UV protection for the selected areas. Thus, those skilled in the art have recognized the need for a device that provides indoor tanning patrons with UV protection for sensitive areas, and particularly for a device that is configured to protect the face, ears, and neck. The claimed invention clearly addresses these and other needs. </p>
<heading level="2" id="h-0003">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>

<p id="p-0022" num="0021"> As mentioned above, the outer surface <b>24</b> of the protective sheet <b>20</b> provides UPF rated ultraviolet light protection. In some embodiments, the protective device <b>10</b> includes two or more side edge-engaging straps <b>30</b> that are fastened to opposing edges of the protective sheet <b>20</b>. Further, in some embodiments, the protective device <b>10</b> does not include an upper edge-engaging strap <b>40</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022"> In some preferred embodiments, the protective device <b>10</b> is constructed from a single layer of UPF-rated, ultraviolet light-resistant material. In such an embodiment, the inner surface <b>22</b> and the outer surface <b>24</b> of the protective sheet <b>20</b> are opposite sides of the same layer of UPF-rated, ultraviolet light-resistant material. In other preferred embodiments, the protective sheet <b>20</b> of the protective device <b>10</b> includes more than one layer of material. In such an embodiment, the inner layer of material may be selected for additional material characteristics, including by way of example only, and not by way of limitation: breathe-ability, heat resistance, elasticity, light reflectivity, smoothness, and softness. </p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"> In one embodiment, an additional layer includes insulating material that reduces potential heat build-up behind the protective sheet <b>20</b>, thereby reducing perspiration that would otherwise have a detrimental and undesirable effect. In another embodiment, an additional inner layer provides additional UPF rated protection. One such suitable UPF rated material is SportUPF, made by Sportex International Inc. Another suitable material is C-gear, made by Solartex Sun Gear, Inc. </p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"> To use a preferred embodiment of the protective device <b>10</b>, a user's head is inserted in the opening of the protective device <b>10</b> created by the protective sheet <b>20</b> and the side edge-engaging strap <b>30</b>, with the inner surface <b>22</b> of the protective sheet <b>20</b> positioned against the user's face. Typically, the user's head is inserted in the opening of the protective device <b>10</b> until the top of the user's head makes contact with the upper edge-engaging strap <b>40</b> that connects the upper edge of the protective sheet <b>20</b> to the center region <b>36</b> of the side edge-engaging strap <b>30</b>. After the protective device is in position on the user's head, protective sheet <b>20</b> covers the user's face, the side edge-engaging strap <b>30</b> is secured around the back of the user's head, and the upper edge-engaging strap <b>40</b> is secured across the top of the user's head. The face of the user is covered and provided with UPF-rated protection as a result of the ultraviolet light-resistant material from which the protective sheet <b>20</b> is constructed. </p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"> In one aspect of a preferred embodiment, the material from which the protective device <b>10</b> is constructed is water resistant. However, in another embodiment, the material from which the protective device <b>10</b> is constructed is not water resistant. In another aspect of a preferred embodiment, the material from which the protective device <b>10</b> is constructed is breathable (i.e., air permeable). However, in another embodiment, the material from which the protective device <b>10</b> is constructed is not breathable. </p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"> In still another aspect of a preferred embodiment, the material from which the protective device <b>10</b> is constructed is heat resistant, while in another embodiment the material from which the protective device <b>10</b> is constructed is not heat resistant. In yet another aspect of a preferred embodiment, the material from which the protective device <b>10</b> is constructed is light reflective, while in another embodiment the material from which the protective device <b>10</b> is constructed is not light reflective. Additionally, the protective device provides the added benefit of increasing sanitary conditions in an indoor tanning environment by preventing the use of a potentially sweaty towel as a &#x201c;make-shift&#x201d; face cover. </p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"> Referring now to other aspects of a preferred embodiment, the protective device <b>10</b>, or at least the outer surface <b>24</b> of the protective device, is produced in a variety of different colors. However, those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that darker colors tend to lend themselves more easily to higher UPF ratings. </p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"> In one preferred embodiment, the protective device <b>10</b> is configured in two sizes. In the first size, the protective sheet <b>20</b> is approximately 12 inches long (i.e., in the direction from the top of the user's head to the bottom of the user's neck) +/&#x2212; an inch. Continuing, in this first size, the protective sheet <b>20</b> is approximately 13 inches wide (i.e., in the direction from one side of a user's head to the other side of a user's head) +/&#x2212; an inch. Additionally, the side edge-engaging strap <b>30</b> is approximately 7&#xbd; inches (+/&#x2212; an inch) from its connection at the first side edge <b>26</b> to its connection at the second side edge <b>28</b>. Further, the upper edge-engaging strap <b>40</b> is approximately 7 inches (+/&#x2212; an inch) from it connection at the upper edge <b>25</b> to its connection at the center region <b>36</b> of the side edge-engaging strap <b>30</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"> In the second size, the protective sheet <b>20</b> is approximately 14 inches long (i.e., in the direction from the top of the user's head to the bottom of the user's neck) +/&#x2212; an inch. Continuing, in this first size, the protective sheet <b>20</b> is approximately 15 inches wide (i.e., in the direction from one side of a user's head to the other side of a user's head) +/&#x2212; an inch. Additionally, the side edge-engaging strap <b>30</b> is approximately 7&#xbd; inches (+/&#x2212; an inch) from its connection at the first side edge <b>26</b> to its connection at the second side edge <b>28</b>. Further, the upper edge-engaging strap <b>40</b> is approximately 7 inches (+/&#x2212; an inch) from it connection at the upper edge <b>25</b> to its connection at the center region <b>36</b> of the side edge-engaging strap <b>30</b>. It will be understood that in other preferred embodiments, various sizes of the protective device <b>10</b> are configured for different sized users. </p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"> Referring again to the UPF-rated material of the protective device <b>10</b>, in one preferred embodiment, at least the outer surface <b>24</b> of the protective sheet <b>20</b> (and possibly the entire protective sheet) provides a 50+ rating for ultraviolet light protection as defined by the ultraviolet protection factor (UPF) classification system. In one embodiment, the outer surface <b>24</b> of the protective sheet <b>20</b> preferably provides a good level of ultraviolet light protection as defined by the UPF classification system, more preferably the protective sheet <b>20</b> provides a very good level of ultraviolet light protection as defined by the UPF classification system, and most preferably the protective sheet <b>20</b> provides an excellent level of ultraviolet light protection as defined by the UPF classification system. </p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"> Unfortunately, it can often be difficult to tell if a fabric offers good sun protection. The Ultraviolet Protection Factor (UPF) shows how well a fabric protects one's skin from ultraviolet light, and thereby enables an individual to choose the proper sun protective clothing. Various factors affect how well a material is rated in the UPF classification system. Such factors include, by way of example only and not by way of limitation: the type of material, the weave of the material, the thickness of the material, and the dyeing of the material. In one exemplary embodiment, a specially woven and dyed polyester fabric is utilized as the UPF-rated material from which the protective device <b>10</b> is constructed. UPF ratings range from 15 to 50, with materials that are rated higher than 50 labeled as UPF 50+. </p>

<?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="tail"?>
<?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?>
<heading level="2" id="h-0001">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002"> This invention has to do with an item of apparel that will cover the arms of a wearer when engaged in water sports. The apparel item is a sleeve, or a pair of sleeves made of neoprene-type fabric that will cover a wearer's wrists, forearms and elbows. </p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003"> A popular family recreational activity on a lake or a river is riding an inner tube pulled behind a boat. The inner tube is attached to the boat by a ski rope. A tube rider hangs on to the tube as best he/she can while the boat operator pulls the rider on a serpentine ride back and forth across the wake of the boat with varying degrees of aggressiveness depending on the skill of the tube rider. Eventually the tube rider may be thrown from the tube. The boat will circle back, pick up the rider and start the entertaining process all over. </p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004"> Since before 1962 &#x201c;tubing&#x201d; was gaining popularity for families that enjoyed lake activities. It is easy to learn; relatively safe, and tubing doesn't required the steep learning curve required to learn how to water ski. Inner tubes have evolved over the years from large truck tire inner tubes to purpose built inflatable structure that have the principle of the inner tube at the core of the design. Some of the newer &#x201c;inner tubes,&#x201d; which may or may not incorporate a truck inner tube, were never intended to be used inside a tire but are, instead, platforms, rings and structures of various shapes purpose built for &#x201c;tubing&#x201d; behind a boat or personal water craft. For instance a nylon canvas covered tube has been on the market since at least 1989. The nylon canvas cover, a textured fabric resulting from being a woven fabric, has an abrasive surface that can rub the hands, elbows, and forearms in a bothersome way. This rubbing of the tube rider's body on the textured fabric causes chafing that leads to sores, eventually producing a scab. There has been a long felt need to come up with a solution and product that will make tubing more enjoyable by eliminating the arm-chaffing problem. Over the years the inventors tried several &#x201c;quick fixes.&#x201d; Ski gloves were used to protect fingers and knuckles. However, finding protection for the forearm and elbows was challenging. In the tubing situation the forearms often support the body on the surface of the tube while the feet, legs and sometimes the torso are off the tube and either in the water or bouncing off the tube and the water. The inventor's family members tried wearing long sleeved t-shirts and even elbow braces to protect them from the chaffing of the tube cover. The long sleeves and elbow braces would either roll up, slide up, or tear apart providing little, if any, protection. No satisfactory solution to the &#x201c;tubing rash&#x201d; problem came to the inventors of the arm guards presented herein. </p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005"> For three years, the inventors discussed possible solutions before deciding to design and develop an arm guard. Eventually, in the design and development of the arm guards, the inventors determined that neoprene would be a good material to use for the arm guards. Neoprene was chosen because it would not slip or shift on the user. It is a very strong and flexible material and can stretch to fit almost anybody. The inventors experience and knowledge of the sport of tubing and the nuances of riding a tube that generated &#x201c;tubing rash&#x201d; gave us information needed to design the arm guard. One discovery was that the arm guard needs to cover the skin from the palm to approximately three inches above the elbow. This would be an ideal approximate length that covers the skin that is subject to abrasion on from the tube. Ski gloves, worn over the arm guard, protect the hand area. </p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"> Having the basic parameters of a preferred design in mind, i.e., neoprene sleeve fitting from the thumb to several inches above the elbow, the inventors searched the market for a product like the arm guards disclosed herein. In a search of catalogues, stores, sports shows, and on line internet searches the inventors found that no product to protect a rider's arms while they are riding on an inner tube was available. </p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007"> Finding neoprene to make our unique design of arm protectors for tubing was problematical. A rubber sheet was procured, but was not the material of first choice. Rubber sheet material or other materials, such as nylon or a natural or synthetic fabric of some type may work in another embodiment of invention but the preferred material is the material that &#x201c;wet suits&#x201d; are made of. Such &#x201c;wet suit&#x201d; fabric or material is generally referred to as &#x201c;neoprene&#x201d; and comes in various thicknesses. For instance, &#x201c;neoprene&#x201d; is available in 1.5 mm to 6 mm thickness and thicknesses greater or lesser than this range of thicknesses is also available. </p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008"> Even though the inventors knew that a preferred embodiment of material for the arm guards is neoprene of the type used in wetsuits, such material was not easy to locate. Local fabric stores didn't carry neoprene fabric. Finally, after several days of searching on-line, the inventors found a dealer that stocked two-millimeter fabric faced, in this case nylon backed, neoprene, one preferred fabric for use in making the arm guards. The material was ordered from the &#x201c;Foam Order&#x201d; website based out of San Francisco, Calif. The neoprene material supplied by Foam Order is a preferred material. It is a 2 mm nylon backed neoprene, which is a good material for the arm guards. </p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009"> A specialized sewing machine is used to stitch the neoprene fabric for the arm guards. An acceptable sewing machine is a &#x201c;four stitch overlay&#x201d; sewing machine. This unique sewing machine lays down an elastic band holding the stitch and shape together while providing the stretch and expandability required for the arm guard. In one embodiment of the arm guards the design is enhanced by sewing a stretch stitch around the perimeter of the thumb hole to give the arm guard a finished look. </p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010"> One embodiment of the invention may use a stretch stitch, not only in the thumb hole, but also at the hand end and, also as a matter of design, at the elbow end of the arm guard. These are optional finishing touches and arm guards may be made without incorporating these optional finishing touches. Such a stitched finish may enhance the look of the device, the wear characteristics of the device and the fit of the arm guards on a person. </p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011"> Various sizes of arm guards are contemplated. For instance, the sizes can include, at least, &#x201c;one size fits most,&#x201d; which is self explanatory; &#x201c;youth,&#x201d; which will fit most children and small adults; and &#x201c;XL,&#x201d; fitting larger adults. Three templates and sizes of neoprene cutouts are shown in the attached drawing The templates are made from thin aluminum sheets for the sake of pattern consistency and durability so that the arm guards out can be cut out perfectly every time. The patterns are placed on the neoprene sheet, the pattern is traced and removed. The arm guard is cut out from the neoprene sheet using a hand held rotary blade cutter on a cutting mat. A craft knife or razor knife are alternatives to the rotary cutter, for use in cutting each individual arm guard out of the neoprene. This method is very time consuming and allows room for &#x201c;operator error.&#x201d; In an alternative method of cutting out the neoprene arm guards, the step of tracing the pattern on the material is eliminated if the pattern is left in place and the rotary knife, or other cutting device, is directed around the template while cutting the neoprene material. Another alternative method of cutting out the arm guards, and a desirable alternative, is the use of a die cut machine to minimize waste from error, to increase utilization of the sheets of neoprene, and to increase productivity. </p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012"> After cutting the arm guard shapes from the neoprene they are sewn such that the flat shape becomes a tubular shape. The &#x201c;four stitch overlay&#x201d; sewing machine lays down an elastic band holding the stitch and shape together while providing the stretch and expandability in the design of the arm guard. In addition to stitching, or as an alternative to stitching, an adhesive can be used to bond the seam making the flat pieces into a tubular structure. </p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013"> The arm guard product was tested by family cousins, enthusiastic tube riders, of the inventors. The arm guards performed perfectly while the prototype testers were riding the inner tubes. The arm guards cover and protect all areas of the arms that would otherwise rub and chafe against the nylon canvas cover on the inner tube. After just one ride, one of the testers said that she was not going to ride again unless she wore the arm guards. This proved the success of the arm guards in protecting the rider from abrasions while tubing. </p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014"> Screen printing of a logo and a company name on each of the arm guards is contemplated. </p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015"> The inventors are environmentally aware and want packaging to be at a minimum. A tagging gun with <b>2</b>&#x2033; hook attachments along with a cardstock product tag can be used to identify the product. This allows the consumer to feel the fabric, texture and &#x201c;heft&#x201d; of the arm guards, each a positive marketing input. As the arm guards are customer accessible the customer can try the arm guard on for size before purchasing. This is also a sales enhancing opportunity as a customer can see the arm guard in place and envision its effectiveness in tube riding activities. </p>

<heading level="2" id="h-0003">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"> In the following description, for the purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the various aspects of the present invention. It will be obvious, however, to one skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without these specific details. </p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"> The arm guards are shown on a wearer in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. Looking first at that figure will give the reader a good idea of how an arm guard will fit on a user. In this <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> an arm guard, generally <b>10</b> is shown on the right arm of the user. The arm guard extends from the palm area of the users hand, over the wrist, forearm and elbow to a point several inches above the user's elbow. This will protect the user's arm from abrading on the surface of a tube <b>12</b> while the user is riding the tube in the water. </p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"> Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-6</figref>, where like numbers identify like or similar elements, the arm guard will be further described. </p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a flat piece of neoprene <b>12</b>; preferably nylon, polyester or lycra covered (one side or two) grade <b>2</b> neoprene as supplied by &#x201c;Foam Order&#x201d; through its online store. The neoprene sheet stock has been cut to the initial shape for a single arm guard. A thumb hole <b>14</b> is cut in the hand end <b>16</b> of the flat piece <b>12</b>. The elbow end <b>20</b> can be straight cut as shown or can be cut with a curve to better accommodate a user's arm above her elbow. </p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"> The right side edge <b>22</b> is attached to the left side edge <b>24</b> and stitched together therewith to form a tubular structure as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-7</figref>. The stitching may be made using &#x201c;four stitch overlay&#x201d; sewing machine that lays down an elastic band holding the stitch and the neoprene material together while providing the stretch and expandability required in the finished arm guard. Point <b>26</b>, point A, is indexed to point <b>28</b>, point B, and point <b>30</b>, point C, is indexed to point <b>32</b>, point D, such that the hand end <b>16</b> of the arm guard has a smoothly curved hand end <b>34</b> and a straight or smoothly curved elbow end <b>36</b>. </p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"> The thumb hole <b>14</b> is preferably the smooth triangular shape as shown in the figures but may be more round, oblong, square or rectangular than is shown in the figures. </p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> however it is for the other arm of the user such that the pieces or blanks, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> make up a set of arm guards. </p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows three arm guard templates, <b>40</b><i>a</i>-<i>c. </i>A youth size is at the left <b>40</b><i>a, </i>a &#x201c;one size fits most&#x201d; is <b>40</b><i>b </i>in the middle and a large arm guard is shown as <b>40</b><i>c. </i>These are used as the patterns for three sizes of arm guards that are being produced and other sizes are, of course, possible. A template, such as <b>40</b><i>a, </i>will be placed on the neoprene sheet material, traced and a blank for forming the arm guard cut out. When using neoprene that is not fabric covered or neoprene that is covered on both sides, that being the front and the back of the neoprene sheet, the &#x201c;handedness&#x201d; of the templates on the fabric doesn't matter. However, when a particular side of the neoprene material needs to be positioned next to the user's skin in the completed arm guard, or a particular side of the neoprene material needs to be on the outer surface of the arm guard when it is completed, then the top side or bottom side of the template matters. For half the arm guards the template will be placed on the neoprene material topside up. On the other half of the arm guards from the same run of complete sets, the template will be place on the neoprene fabric bottom side up, that is, flipped over from the first position. The template will be flipped over once per pair of arm guards. </p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows the three sizes of completed arm guards. Two arm guards of each size will make up a pair of arm guards. In this figure a tab, each labeled <b>42</b> is visible. These tabs are product hang tags. They are used to indicate the manufacturer of the arm guards and contain information concerning the arm guard. </p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"> As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, it is preferred that the seams <b>44</b> of the arm guards <b>10</b> are on the top of the wearer's arms. A flat seam can be made, that being the preferred seam, or an overlapped seam could be made. It is best to have the seam flat and smooth inside the arm guard for comfort. </p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"> One advantage of the neoprene arm guard is that they are designed to not have any water retention cavities. This is desirable to avoid the &#x201c;skunkiness&#x201d; possible if lake water was trapped for days in a cavity. Also, it is easy to clean these arm guards as they can be easily turned inside out assuring that both the inner surface and the outer surface can be washed in soap water. </p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"> In summary the apparatus is an article of protective wear comprising an elongated arm guard having a hand end and an elbow end. The arm guard is open at each end. The hand end of the arm guard has an aperture formed in the arm guard and this aperture is spaced away from the open hand end of the arm guard. This aperture forms a thumbhole. Since the arm guard is formed from a flat blank, a seam is formed along the length of the elongated arm guard and the thumb hole is offset from the seam location. It is preferred that the arm guard is formed of neoprene material and this neoprene may fabric backed in one embodiment. </p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"> The disclosure sets forth a method of protecting a tube rider from arm abrasions through the acts of providing a pair of arm guards and placing the arm guards on the arms of the tube rider. The arm guards are tubular structures of neoprene material having a hand end and an elbow end. The hand end may have a thumbhole formed therein. One method of making the arm guard comprises the acts of cutting out a blank of material, the material being a neoprene material which may have a fabric coating on one or both sides of a neoprene core, in a desired shape, cutting a thumb hole in a hand end of the blank, the blank having a right side edge and a left side edge, connecting the left side edge to the right side edge, this can be done by any of several methods such as sewing the edges together, taping the edges together, gluing the edges together, heat welding the edges together, or the like. A tubular like structure is thus formed from the blank. </p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"> Having fully disclosed the various aspects of the invention and some of its exemplary embodiments, methods and applications, those skilled in the art will undoubtedly expand its application and devise other embodiments while still being within the scope and spirit of the invention as recited in the following claims. </p>

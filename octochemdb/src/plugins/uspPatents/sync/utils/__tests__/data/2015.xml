<p id="p-0005" num="0004">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present invention relates to aprons used to protect a wearer's underlying clothing, and more particularly to aprons which provide a continuous protective layer around the periphery of the wearer.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The basic concept of an apron is well known, as evidenced by numerous patents and products which attempt to address the problem of clothing protection. In most cases, a large section of fabric is positioned in front of the wearer, covering the chest and torso, as well as the waist and legs. The apron is typically suspended on the body of the wearer by a strap which is disposed around the back of the wearer's neck. The open sides of the apron are gathered around the back of the wearer, and secured around the waist by a pair of strings or straps which are tied. While this arrangement can be effective for many purposes, there are a number of deficiences which become apparent, particularly when worn in certain industrial environments.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">For example, the use of strings to tie the open sides of the apron can present a dangerous risk to the wearer. Strings dangling from the apron can easily be caught in moving or rotating machinery, especially in food production facilities like meat processing, bakeries, and the like. Also, the basic apron design necessarily results in an open area behind the wearer where the two sides do not fully close. This open area exposes the seat and legs of the wearer to undesireable substances, including food products, grease, cleaning solutions, and similar materials that should never contact the wearer's skin or clothing. Moreover, the skin or clothing of the wearer should never come into contact with tools, utensils, surfaces, food, and other sensitive material in the work environment whose cleanliness or purity must be maintained for quality or safety reasons. Finally, because such conventional aprons often become loose on the wearer, there is a frequent need to untie and retie the strings on the apron to secure it on the wearer. Over the course of a typical work day, such re-tying operation may happen 10-15 times. Of course, such handling requires manual contact with the fabric strings which may have absorbed food or industrial chemicals, further resulting in possible cross-contmination between the wearer and the surrounding work envionment.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">What is needed is an apron that is hands-free and string-less apron which provides a more safe and sanitary alternative to the traditional apron, particularly when used in food service or other similar industrial environments. A wrap-around and closeable lower section which completely surrounds the wearer's legs would minimize soiling of underlying clothing and prevent unwanted contamination. Moreover, the absence of a fastening string or strap removes the risks that such string or strap may become entangled in machinery or contacted by substances that would otherwise be harmful or undersirable to the wearer or consumers of the products being handled.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Therefore, an apron constructed from a flexible material is provided, comprising an upper section shaped and dimensioned to substantially cover the abdomen of a wearer, a lower section operatively attached to the upper section, wherein the lower section has a bottom edge extending below the knees of a wearer, and wherein the lower section is shaped and dimensioned to completely surround the waist and legs of the wearer when in a closed configuration; an elastic waist band connected between the upper section and the lower section, wherein the elastic waist band completely surrounds the waist of the wearer when in a close configuration; a neck strap extending from the upper section adapted to rest behind the neck of the wearer; and a closure device extending substantially vertically between the elastic waist band and the bottom edge, wherein the closure device is adapted to close the lower section.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The apron preferably includes a fastener on the elastic waist band adapted to close the elastic waist band, wherein the fastener may be a snap device.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In a preferred embodiment, the elastic waist band is an elastic fabric stitched between the upper section and the lower section.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Preferably, the closure device is a zipper.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The flexible material may be a fabric, preferably water repellent, or a plastic sheeting material.</p>

<heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Before the subject invention is further described, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited to the particular embodiments of the invention described below, as variations of the particular embodiments may be made and still fall within the scope of the appended claims. It is also to be understood that the terminology employed is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments, and is not intended to be limiting. Instead, the scope of the present invention will be established by the appended claims.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In this specification and the appended claims, the singular forms &#x201c;a,&#x201d; &#x201c;an,&#x201d; and &#x201c;the&#x201d; include plural reference unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood to one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Referring now to the drawings, and in particular <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a hands-free, string-less apron <b>1</b> is provided, comprising an upper section <b>2</b> and a lower section <b>3</b>, both constructed from a flexible material, such as a fabric or plastic material. Preferably, if the flexible material is a fabric, it is treated with a water repellant compound to prevent or minimize absorption of undesirable substances.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The upper section <b>2</b> includes a neck strap <b>4</b> for resting behind the neck of a wearer, and the upper section <b>2</b> is intended to substantially cover the abdomen of the wearer. The lower section <b>3</b> is attached to the upper section <b>2</b>, and the upper and lower sections <b>2</b>, <b>3</b> are separated by an elastic waist band <b>5</b> extending along the top edge of the lower section. Preferably, the elastic waist band <b>5</b> is an elastic fabric stitched between the upper section <b>2</b> and the lower section <b>3</b>. Alternatively, the elastic waist band <b>5</b> is an elastic band which resides within an enclosed channel of fabric loosely sewn around the band. As will be appreciated, the elastic waist band <b>5</b> serves to keep the apron <b>1</b> secured around the wearer, and allows the apron <b>1</b> to comfortably fit a wide range of waist sizes.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The lower section <b>3</b> completely surrounds the waist and legs of the wearer when in a closed configuration. The lower section <b>3</b> includes a closure device <b>6</b>, such as zipper, extending substantially vertically between the elastic waist band <b>5</b> and the bottom edge <b>7</b> of the lower section <b>3</b>. Optionally, a snap fastener <b>8</b> is also located on the waist band <b>5</b> to assist in closing the apron <b>1</b> around the wearer. As indicated above, the lack of tying strings results in an apron that is essentially hands-free and string-less, because it does not require successive re-tying over the course of the work day. The absence of a fastening string or strap removes the risks that such string or strap may become entangled in machinery, which could result in damage to the wearer and equipment. The wrap-around and closeable lower section which completely surrounds the wearer's legs minimizes soiling of underlying clothing and prevents contamination. Thus, the invention described herein provides a more safe and sanitary alternative to the traditional apron, particularly when used in food service or other similar industrial environments.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">All references cited in this specification are herein incorporated by reference as though each reference was specifically and individually indicated to be incorporated by reference. The citation of any reference is for its disclosure prior to the filing date and should not be construed as an admission that the present invention is not entitled to antedate such reference by virtue of prior invention.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">It will be understood that each of the elements described above, or two or more together may also find a useful application in other types of methods differing from the type described above. Without further analysis, the foregoing will so fully reveal the gist of the present invention that others can, by applying current knowledge, readily adapt it for various applications without omitting features that, from the standpoint of prior art, fairly constitute essential characteristics of the generic or specific aspects of this invention set forth in the appended claims. The foregoing embodiments are presented by way of example only, and the scope of the present invention is to be limited only by the following claims.</p>

<?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a breathable waterproof water aerobics cover for the hair made of waterproof fabrics that are stretchable, soft, durable, reliable, and breathable allowing air to penetrate without the hair getting wet.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The main purpose for the breathable waterproof water aerobics cover for the hair is to prevent the hair from flattening, and to prevent the lost of volume, body and style in the hair on the head cause by tension from wearing a swimming cap, a hair wrap, or any hair cover that confines the hair to the scalp when used doing water aerobics or water sports without air penetration.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The breathable waterproof water aerobics cover for the hair has the stretchable capacity to have ample interior space to accommodate most lengths and masses of hair without applying tension. It will allow the wearer to retain their coiffure with the volume, body and style.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The periphery of the waterproof water aerobics cover for the hair will have dimensions that will adapt to the circumference of the wearer's head. The periphery of the breathable waterproof water aerobics cover for the hair will be made with or without pleats, tucks, folds or gathers along each side and along the front and or back that expands to allow ease of fit when accommodating the hair.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">To obtain a secure fit that will prevent water penetration to the hair from around the periphery of the waterproof water aerobics cover for the hair, the periphery would have breathable waterproof fabric in the form of a strip or a loop that interlocks or dovetail with another well known brand of stretchable waterproof fabric. The two fabrics will be sewn together to the periphery using a thread with the capability to stretch with complete recovery to further protect the hair from getting wet.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The water aerobics hair cover will come in a variety of sizes, shapes, designs, and bright vivid colors. Some fabric textures may require an interior fabric stiffener to support the pleats, tucks folds, or gathers or an interior lining.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The utility U.S. Pat. No. 3,996,621 to Martienssen, Dec. 14, 1976 the materials used in this prior art is an important factor. The material used for the bathing cap is not a breathable waterproof material and does not allow air penetration. Without air penetration to the head and hair when doing intense physical activities such as water aerobics or water sports, the hair will revert back to its natural state because of the moisture in the hair from perspiration.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The tucks, folds or gathers used in the prior art for expansion Is not a pertinent part of the present art, and is not necessary for the function of the present art because the present art will use stretchable fabric that will provide ample interior space to accommodate the hair.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">As cited in prior art, &#x201c;elastomeric strip around its periphery with the reinforced expansion and recovery that prevent penetration of water&#x201d;, this function will also prevent the penetration of air. In my opinion, this prior art has no penetration of air at all to the head or hair with the material used, and the function of the elastomeric strip that surrounds the periphery for expansion and recovered to the head seals the bathing cap to prevent water penetration and air penetration. What differentiates the two arts is the breathable waterproof material used in the present art. The prior art of Martienssen would not suffice for retaining the hair when doing intense physical water activities such as water aerobics or water sports.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The utility U.S. Pat. No. 2,533,879 to Di Giovanna, Dec. 12, 1950 has also been provided as another example of an invention which is related to the present invention and is relevant to the extent that a similar function is disclosed. Di Giovanna's invention was an improvement over the manner in which the design of the bathing cap was previously made. The present art is an overall improvement over the manner in which the prior art was made, how the prior art prevented the hair from getting wet, how the prior maintained the hair style, and the design of the prior art.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Most importantly, is the material used in the main body of the prior art which was molded rubber, or plastic, in the form of a rugged plastic material that does not allow air to penetrate.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Whereas, the present art is made of soft breathable waterproof fabrics that does allow air to penetrate so that the hair and scalp could breath and stay cool without the Hair getting wet and losing its style, while still being fashionable enough for the wearer to look updated, and cute.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The prior art would cause the hair to perspire when doing an intense physical water activity or water sport assuring that the hair style is lost. In my opinion, the material used and the function of this prior art is more in a relationship or class with a swimming cap.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The U.S. Pat. No. 4,378,606 to Snowden, Apr. 15, 1983 described preferred material called Quiana for the use in this prior art. This material does not exist. Therefore I referenced a material called Qiana, which is a silky nylon material. Snowden claim the material to be water repellent (which resist the absorption of water), however, there is a difference between waterproof in present art and water repellent in prior art. (http://www.ehow.com/facts<sub>&#x2014;</sub>7682877_difference-waterproof-water-repellent.html) &#x201c;ctrl click or copy paste to follow link&#x201d;. Using a water repellent fabric while doing intense physical water aerobics exercise, the water splashes alone will eventually penetrate to the hair causing the wearer to lose their hairdo.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The U.S. Pat. No. 3,206,761 to Melnikoff, Mar. 8, 1963 Is another example of the type of material used for retaining the hairdo. The materials used, or preferred in the prior art are polyethylene (plastic), polyvinyl chloride, acetate or rubber, &#x201c;The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA.) in 2000 proposed national standards to limit air toxic emissions from polyvinyl, chloride production. plants. Read more: http://www.ehow.com/facts<sub>&#x2014;</sub>5911437_polyvinyl_.html&#x201d;. These materials are flexible and are impermeable to water, but also impermeable to the penetration of air as well. Therefore in my opinion, without the right waterproof materials which are breathable, the hair will revert back to its natural state when doing an intense physical water activity such as water aerobics.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The manner in which the present claimed apparatus will be employed differentiates from prior art is in a significant manner, which is the materials used, and the function of the materials used. Intense physical water activities such as water aerobics or water sports require a hair cover made of a fabric that will allow air to penetrate to keep the head, cool to avoid perspiration. Fabrics with this quality will keep the hair from going back to its natural state.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Prior art cited were not intended for use in intense physical water activities such as water aerobics exercising or water sports. It is a known fact that if the hair is confined or covered, either loose or tight with a material that does not allow the penetration of air, the hair will perspire and lose everything, the volume, body, and style. The entire hairdo would be lost.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The materials used in the present claimed apparatus for doing water aerobics will allow air to penetrate without letting the hair get wet. When it comes to the hair, the volume, body and style is what really matter. The key to retaining it all when doing water aerobics or water sports is in the present art which uses fabrics that are soft, durable, breathable, reliable and waterproof. &#x201c;Air in, water out, hair the volume, body and style is retained&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The present art, and each prior art cited, can be worn to participate in water aerobics or water sports to protect the hair from. water. However, when using any of the prior arts for water aerobics exercising or water sports, the wearer would be using a product for something other than its intended purpose, and the end result for doing that is the total loss of a hairdo, the volume, body and the style.</p>

<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The embodiments disclosed herein relate to the field of athletics and particularly to devices for warming the throwing arm of an athlete.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Athletes participating in throwing activities often cover their throwing arms during rest periods or warm-up periods in an attempt to keep their throwing arms warm. An example of this is a baseball pitcher who comes out of a game between innings. In this situation, the pitcher often puts on a full-size quilted winter jacket in an attempt to keep his throwing arm and shoulder warm while the pitcher's team bats. However, because baseball is primarily played in the summer, it is often very hot and most pitchers will only place one arm in the jacket. The remainder of the jacket falls to the ground where it is subject to damage from cleats, dirt, and other ground level dugout assaults. If the pitcher does prevent the jacket from falling to the ground in some way, the remainder of the jacket will tend to cover his body and cause him to sweat. Sweat has an adverse effect on gripping a baseball, and is undesirable for the pitcher. Therefore, a full winter jacket used by a baseball player to simply keep one arm and shoulder warm is inefficient and awkward.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In addition to keeping a single arm warm during sedentary periods, the athlete may also wish to keep the single arm warm during warm-up and other activities. However, draping a full winter jacket over a single arm is very inefficient and clumsy for warm-up, so athletes often completely forego any additional warming garment during warm-up activities. The result is that the throwing arm may cool more than desired during such light warm-up activities.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In view of the foregoing, it would be desirable to provide a device capable of warming a single arm of an athlete without also warming other parts of the body. It would also be advantageous if the device could be used to keep a single arm and shoulder warm without the awkwardness of a full jacket. Furthermore, it would be advantageous if such device were durable and capable of withstanding dugout and sideline conditions during sporting events. Moreover, it would be advantageous if such device could be quickly and easily donned and removed by the athlete.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref>, in at least one embodiment, an arm warmer <b>110</b> includes an arm portion <b>120</b> and a torso portion <b>150</b>. The arm portion <b>120</b> is designed to cover an athlete's throwing arm and shoulder while only covering a small amount of the remainder of the athlete's body. This allows the arm warmer <b>110</b> to keep the athlete's throwing arm and shoulder warm, while allowing other portions of the athlete's body to remain cool. In various embodiments disclosed herein, the arm portion <b>120</b> is shown as a single arm configured to cover the right arm of the wearer, however, it will be recognized that the embodiments of the arm warmer <b>110</b> may be symmetric in design such that the single arm <b>120</b> when shown as covering the right arm of the wearer could also be provided as a single arm covering the left arm of the wearer (i.e., alternative embodiments will be illustrated by flipping the components shown in a given figure from the right side to the left side of the wearer's body, and vice-versa).</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The single arm <b>120</b> is generally comprised of a fabric material that is capable of retaining heat and providing a warming effect to the athlete's arm and shoulder. Accordingly, the single arm <b>120</b> may be generally comprised of a knit, woven, or non-woven construction, or a combination of such constructions. Furthermore, the single arm <b>120</b> may be comprised of any of various materials, such as polyester, cotton, elastane, or other material or combination thereof. In at least one embodiment, the single arm <b>120</b> may include a two-layer construction where two different fabrics are combined to provide the desired effect. In such a two-layer construction, an inner layer closest to the skin may be used to wick moisture away from the skin and/or provide compression to the wearer's arm. An outer layer may be used to provide warmth to the wearer's arm.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The single arm <b>120</b> provides a sleeve <b>122</b> that covers the wearer's throwing arm. The sleeve <b>122</b> includes a wrist end <b>124</b> and a shoulder end <b>140</b>. The shoulder end <b>140</b> of the sleeve <b>122</b> is connected to a shoulder portion <b>142</b> along a seam. The wrist end <b>124</b> may includes a cuff arrangement, including an interior cuff <b>126</b> and an exterior cuff <b>128</b>. The exterior cuff <b>128</b> generally extends over and covers the interior cuff <b>126</b> at the end <b>124</b> of the sleeve <b>122</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The exterior cuff <b>128</b> is adjustable such that the circumference of the cuff may be changed based on the size of the user's wrist. Accordingly, the exterior cuff <b>128</b> may include a flap configured to move relative to a pad on the cuff and change the circumference of the exterior cuff <b>128</b>. For example, the flap may include a hook portion of a hook-and-loop arrangement, and the pad may include the loop portion. Such an arrangement allows the user repeatedly change the position of the flap relative to the pad and therefore adjust the circumference of the outer cuff. This allows the user to tightly wrap the exterior cuff <b>128</b> around the wrist in order to trap heat within the sleeve <b>122</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Alternatively or in addition to the heat trapping qualities of the exterior cuff <b>128</b>, the interior cuff <b>126</b> may also be configured to prevent heat from escaping the sleeve <b>122</b> at the end of the arm <b>120</b>. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref>, the interior cuff <b>126</b> is generally comprised of an elastic material that expands to allow the wearer's hand to pass through and contracts to hold closely to the wearer's wrist. Accordingly, the elastic interior cuff <b>126</b> acts to retain heat within the sleeve by closing around the wrist of the wearer and preventing heat from escaping at the end of the sleeve <b>122</b>. Although the cuff arrangement of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref> has been described herein as including both an interior cuff <b>126</b> and an exterior cuff <b>128</b>, it will be recognized that only a single cuff may be provided in various other embodiments of the arm warmer <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref>, the sleeve <b>122</b> includes a zipper arrangement <b>130</b> that extends along the substantial length of the sleeve from the shoulder end <b>140</b> to the wrist end <b>124</b>. As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the zipper arrangement <b>130</b> includes an upper zipper pull <b>132</b> and a lower zipper pull <b>134</b>. When the upper zipper pull <b>132</b> is moved downward (i.e., in the direction of arrow <b>133</b>), the teeth of the zipper arrangement <b>130</b> are disengaged (i.e., unzipped), opening the portion of the zipper arrangement <b>130</b> above the pull <b>132</b> and exposing an interior portion of the sleeve <b>122</b>. Similarly, when the lower zipper pull <b>134</b> is moved upward (i.e., in the direction of arrow <b>135</b>), the teeth of the zipper arrangement are disengaged (i.e., unzipped), opening the portion of the zipper arrangement <b>130</b> below the pull <b>134</b>, and exposing an interior portion of the sleeve <b>122</b>. This provides an adjustable ventilation arrangement on the sleeve <b>122</b>, allowing the user to create one or two openings of a desired size in the sleeve based on positioning of the upper zipper pull <b>132</b> and lower zipper pull <b>134</b>. In at least one embodiment, nothing on the inside of the sleeve <b>122</b> behind the zipper arrangement <b>130</b>, such that the open zipper arrangement <b>130</b> creates a hole in the sleeve that provides direct access to the arm of the wearer. However, in other embodiments, a lightweight breathable fabric may be positioned on the inside of the sleeve <b>122</b> behind the zipper arrangement <b>130</b>. The lightweight breathable fabric may be, for example, a lightweight polyester material or a mesh material that allows for significant airflow through the material. In other embodiments, the zipper arrangement <b>130</b> may be configured to provide for adjustable compression on the sleeve <b>122</b>. Such an adjustable compression zipper arrangement is explained in further detail below with respect to the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-8</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">With continued reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref>, a thumb grip <b>129</b> is provided on the wrist end <b>124</b> of the sleeve <b>122</b> on the opposite side of the sleeve <b>122</b> from the zipper arrangement <b>130</b>. The thumb grip <b>129</b> is provided as a cylindrical fabric portion on the outer cuff <b>128</b> that is configured to receive the thumb of the wearer and assist the wearer in removing or donning the warmer device <b>110</b>. In particular, the user may insert the thumb or other finger from the opposite hand of the user into the thumb grip <b>129</b> when the user removes his or her arm from the sleeve <b>122</b> to prevent the sleeve from turning inside-out. This thumb grip <b>129</b> is especially useful if a compression material such as elastane is used as a fabric for the sleeve <b>122</b>. The perimeter of the thumb grip <b>129</b> may include a durable, relatively rigid or hard material, such as a plastic rim or a perimeter of reinforced stitching that provides a ring structure for the user to grab with his or her thumb.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The torso portion <b>150</b> of the arm warmer <b>110</b> is connected to the arm portion <b>120</b> along a seam along an edge of the shoulder portion <b>142</b>. The torso portion <b>150</b> includes the shoulder portion <b>142</b>, a chest portion <b>160</b>, and a shoulder harness <b>170</b>, with a neck opening <b>164</b> defined by the shoulder portion <b>142</b>, chest portion <b>160</b> and the shoulder harness <b>170</b>. Although the arm warmer may include the seam between the arm portion <b>120</b> and the torso portion <b>150</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, it will be recognized that in other embodiments, the arm portion <b>120</b> and the torso portion <b>150</b> may be integrally formed such that no seam or other distinct coupling is provided at transition from the arm portion <b>120</b> to the torso portion <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">A partial collar <b>152</b> provided along an upper edge of the chest portion <b>160</b> and the shoulder portion <b>142</b>. The partial collar <b>152</b> extends about half way around one side of the user's neck. Together, the partial collar <b>152</b> and the shoulder harness <b>170</b> define the neck opening <b>164</b> for the arm warmer <b>110</b>. A shoulder pad <b>154</b> is positioned on the inside of the shoulder portion <b>142</b> and chest portion <b>160</b> and extends from the partial collar <b>152</b> toward the shoulder end <b>140</b> of the sleeve <b>122</b>. The shoulder pad <b>154</b> is comprised of a grippy material that provides a surface with a relatively high coefficient of friction. The grippy material may be, for example, plastisol, such as a tackyifying ink comprised of PVC (polyvinyl chloride). Alternatively, the grippy material may be any of various other materials that will provide a surface with a high coefficient of friction, as will be recognized by those of skill in the art. Accordingly, the shoulder pad <b>154</b> provides a grip member on an interior of the shoulder portion <b>142</b> (and/or chest portion) of the arm warmer <b>110</b> that is configured to contact the shirt of a user and prevent slippage of the torso portion <b>150</b> on the user. Although not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a webbing handle may also be provided on the inside of the arm warmer <b>110</b> near the shoulder portion <b>142</b>. The webbing handle may facilitate hanging or carrying of the device by the user.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The shoulder portion <b>142</b> of the torso portion <b>150</b> is configured to cover a substantial portion of the user's shoulder. The chest portion <b>160</b> is coupled to the shoulder portion <b>142</b> and extends downward from the partial collar <b>152</b>. The chest portion <b>160</b> is configured to substantially cover the pectoral muscle on the right side of the user without covering the opposite left shoulder and left pectoral muscle of the user. While the shoulder portion <b>142</b> and chest portion <b>160</b> are generally described as covering the user's shoulder and chest, respectively, it will be recognized that the shoulder portion <b>142</b> may actually extend to a portion of the wearer's chest, and the chest portion <b>160</b> may actually extend to a portion of the wearer's shoulder.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The chest portion <b>160</b> also includes a complimentary back section (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) that is configured to cover a corresponding portion of a user's back. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the shoulder portion <b>142</b> and chest portion <b>160</b> are generally comprised of the same material as the sleeve <b>122</b> of the arm warmer <b>110</b>. In various other embodiments described in further detail below, the shoulder portion <b>142</b> or chest portion <b>160</b> may be comprised of other material such as a relatively rigid material or a foam material. The chest portion <b>160</b> may include an outer layer <b>162</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) and an inner layer <b>166</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) with a pocket <b>167</b> in between. An opening <b>168</b> to this pocket is provided along the front left side of the chest portion <b>160</b>. This opening <b>168</b> may be configured to receive weights, such as a plate, that urges the chest portion <b>160</b> into engagement with the chest of the wearer. Additional embodiments of the arm warmer <b>110</b> with weights retained on the torso portion are described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 23-24</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The shoulder harness <b>170</b> is connected to the chest portion <b>160</b> and is configured to rest on an opposite shoulder of the user from the chest portion <b>160</b>. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref>, the shoulder harness <b>170</b> includes straps <b>172</b> and a shoulder anchor <b>174</b>. The shoulder anchor <b>174</b> is configured to rest on the opposite shoulder of the user from the chest portion <b>160</b>. The shoulder anchor <b>174</b> includes a frame <b>176</b> and an inner shoulder pad <b>178</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The frame <b>176</b> of the shoulder anchor <b>174</b> is comprised of a relatively rigid structure. Accordingly, the frame <b>176</b> may be comprised of a compression molded plastic material such as polyethylene. The frame <b>176</b> is contoured in a convex shape and is configured to rest on the upper shoulder of the wearer. The frame includes a plurality of strap couplings <b>180</b> that retain the straps <b>172</b> of the shoulder harness <b>170</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The straps <b>172</b> of the shoulder harness <b>170</b> extend between the chest portion <b>160</b> and the shoulder frame <b>176</b>. In particular, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the straps extend between the strap couplings <b>180</b> on the frame <b>176</b> and ladder lock buckles <b>182</b> connected to the chest portion <b>160</b>. The ladder lock buckles <b>182</b> allow the length of the straps to be adjusted such that the torso portion <b>150</b> may be adjusted to properly fit the user and comfortably retain the arm warmer <b>110</b> on the user. As in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3</figref>, the ladder lock buckles <b>182</b> may be concealed on the pocket <b>167</b> between the outer fabric layer <b>162</b> and the inner fabric layer <b>166</b> of the chest portion <b>160</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The frame <b>176</b> of the shoulder anchor <b>174</b> further includes a handle <b>184</b> along the neck opening <b>164</b>. The handle <b>184</b> is provided as a raised surface on the frame <b>176</b> that is designed and dimensioned to receive the fingers of the user. Accordingly, the user may easily and conveniently grasp the frame <b>176</b> at the handle <b>184</b> in order to carry or otherwise manipulate the arm warmer <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">With particular reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the frame <b>176</b> of the shoulder anchor includes a central pocket <b>190</b> that is configured to receive a customized printed material. The central pocket <b>190</b> includes a transparent window <b>192</b> that faces the exterior side of the frame <b>176</b>. The transparent window <b>192</b> is generally comprised of a transparent sheet of a polymer material. The transparent window <b>192</b> may also be comprised of other materials or may be completely void such that the window is an open window. An opening <b>194</b> to the central pocket <b>190</b> is provided along an upper side portion of the transparent window <b>192</b>. The opening <b>194</b> is sufficiently sized and shaped to receive a card <b>196</b> or other media having a logo, text, or design printed thereon. For example, a card <b>196</b> with a team logo and/or player number may be inserted into the pocket <b>190</b> to decorate the arm warmer <b>110</b> or identify ownership of the arm warmer <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The shoulder anchor <b>174</b> also includes an interior shoulder pad <b>178</b> that is positioned inside of the frame <b>176</b> and comprised of a grippy material. The grippy material for the interior shoulder pad <b>178</b> will generally be the same as the material used for the shoulder pad <b>154</b> on the opposing shoulder, as described above. Accordingly, the shoulder pad <b>178</b> provides an interior surface with a high coefficient of friction that resists slippage when engaged with the shirt of the user. Moreover, the grippy material used for both shoulder pads <b>178</b> and <b>154</b> is relatively flexible and soft, thus providing comfort to the user.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">With particular reference again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, when the arm warmer <b>110</b> is worn by the user, the torso portion <b>150</b> and shoulder harness <b>170</b> extend from a position under the user's throwing arm to the shoulder opposite the throwing arm without encircling the torso of the wearer below the shoulders. Therefore, even though the arm warmer <b>110</b> covers an area under the user's throwing arm in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref>, the arm warmer <b>110</b> does not extend to a position under the opposite (non-throwing) arm of the user. The user may don the arm warmer <b>110</b> by simply passing his or her head through the neck opening <b>164</b> and inserting his or her throwing arm into the sleeve <b>122</b>. The sleeve <b>122</b> helps keep the user's throwing arm and associated shoulder warm while allowing the rest of the body to remain cool.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Embodiment with Internal Compression and Sleeve Reinforcements</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-8</figref> an alternative embodiment of the arm warmer <b>110</b> is shown by arm warmer <b>210</b>. In this embodiment, the arm warmer <b>210</b> is similar to the arm warmer <b>110</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref>, but the arm warmer <b>210</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-8</figref> does not include the shoulder harness <b>170</b>. Additionally, the arm warmer <b>210</b> includes a plurality of reinforcement members <b>212</b> on the sleeve <b>222</b>. Moreover, the arm warmer <b>210</b> includes a zipper arrangement <b>230</b> that is configured to provide ventilation and/or compression to the arm of the user.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, the plurality of reinforcement members <b>212</b> include a shoulder support <b>214</b>, an upper arm support <b>216</b>, and a forearm support <b>218</b>. The various reinforcement supports <b>212</b>, <b>214</b> and <b>216</b> are provided on the sleeve <b>222</b> to provide some rigidity to the sleeve <b>222</b> while still allowing for user mobility. The reinforcement supports <b>212</b> are generally comprised of a relatively heavy material that adds weight to the sleeve <b>222</b> and stabilizes the sleeve by providing a shell-like effect on the outer surface of the sleeve <b>222</b>. In at least one embodiment, the reinforcement supports may be comprised of heavy duty ballistic nylon or similar material. In another exemplary embodiment, the reinforcement supports may be comprised of a natural or synthetic rubber material, ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA) or thermoplastic polyurethanes (TPU). The reinforcement supports <b>212</b> may be formed by any of various processes such as compression molding.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the reinforcement supports <b>212</b> may be provided in various shapes. The shoulder support <b>214</b> is generally rectangular and includes a raised portion <b>244</b> (as best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) that provides a handle <b>284</b> for the arm warmer <b>210</b>. The handle <b>284</b> is designed and dimensioned to receive the fingers of the user, allowing the user to easily and conveniently grasp the shoulder support <b>214</b> at the handle <b>284</b> in order to carry or otherwise manipulate the arm warmer <b>210</b>. Both the upper arm support <b>216</b> and the forearm support <b>218</b> are somewhat rectangular and include pointed portions <b>246</b> that point toward an elbow on the sleeve <b>222</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the arm warmer <b>210</b> may provide further reinforcement by including a shoulder clip <b>256</b> on the inside of the shoulder portion <b>242</b>. The shoulder clip <b>256</b> is a resilient member that is configured to wrap around the shoulder of the user and gently squeeze the shoulder, providing a compressive effect on the shoulder. The shoulder clip <b>256</b> may be comprised of any of various materials such as a foam material or a plastic material.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">In addition to the reinforcement supports <b>212</b> and the shoulder clip <b>256</b>, the arm warmer <b>210</b> in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-8</figref> further includes a zipper arrangement <b>230</b> that provides for ventilation and adjustable compression on the sleeve <b>222</b>. As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the sleeve <b>222</b> includes an outer fabric layer <b>223</b> and an inner fabric layer <b>225</b>. The reinforcement supports <b>212</b> are provided on the outer fabric layer <b>223</b>, and the zipper arrangement <b>230</b> is provided on the inner fabric layer <b>225</b>. The outer fabric layer <b>223</b> includes a flap <b>227</b> that may be pulled back to reveal the zipper arrangement on the inner fabric layer <b>225</b>. The flap <b>227</b> may be secured on the outer fabric layer <b>223</b> using any of various means known in the art, such as a hook and loop arrangement.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the zipper arrangement <b>230</b> on the inner fabric layer <b>225</b> includes a first zipper <b>232</b> and a second zipper <b>234</b>. The first zipper <b>232</b> and the second zipper <b>234</b> extend from the wrist end <b>224</b> to the shoulder end <b>240</b> of the arm warmer <b>210</b> in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. However, in other embodiments, the zippers <b>232</b>, <b>234</b> may only extend along a portion of the sleeve <b>222</b>, such as from the wrist end <b>224</b> to the elbow. Because the fabric on the inner fabric layer <b>225</b> is a compression material, closing (i.e., unzipping) the zippers <b>232</b> and <b>234</b> will increase the compression provided by the inner fabric layer <b>225</b>, while opening (i.e., zipping) the zippers <b>232</b> and <b>234</b> will decrease the compression provided by the inner fabric layer <b>225</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>, shows a cross-sectional illustration of the first zipper <b>232</b> and the second zipper <b>234</b> on the sleeve <b>222</b> along line VIII-VIII of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. The first zipper <b>232</b> is shown in an open position (i.e., unzipped state), and the second zipper is shown in a closed position (i.e., zipped state). The first zipper <b>232</b> includes a backing layer <b>236</b> comprised of a fabric material. This fabric material on the backing layer <b>236</b> may be a compression material, similar to the other material on the inner fabric layer <b>225</b>, or may be another type of fabric material. In any event, the backing layer <b>236</b> is provided on the inside of the zipper elements for the first zipper <b>232</b> and limits the distance that opposing sides of the first zipper <b>232</b> may be removed from each other on the sleeve <b>222</b>. Accordingly, when the first zipper <b>232</b> is opened, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>, and the second zipper <b>234</b> is closed, the sleeve <b>222</b> retains some degree of compression since the distance between the opposing sides of the first zipper <b>232</b> is limited by the backing layer <b>236</b>. However, if the second zipper <b>234</b> is opened, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>, no compression will be provided by the sleeve <b>222</b> because no backing layer is provided behind the second zipper <b>234</b>. Accordingly, the first zipper <b>232</b> and the second zipper <b>234</b> on the sleeve <b>222</b> may be used to provide the user with an adjustable degree of compression on his or her throwing arm. In particular, at least three different levels of adjustability are provided by the zipper arrangement, including no compression (i.e., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>), low compression (i.e., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>), and high compression (i.e., both the first zipper <b>232</b> and the second zipper <b>234</b> closed). Additionally, it will be recognized that the zipper arrangement <b>230</b> also provides for ventilation to the user's arm, if desired, by opening the flap <b>227</b> on the sleeve <b>222</b> and opening the second zipper <b>234</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Embodiment with Sleeve Reinforcements and Adjustable Vents</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9-12</figref> another alternative embodiment is shown by arm warmer <b>310</b>. In this embodiment, the arm warmer <b>310</b> is similar to the arm warmer <b>210</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-8</figref>, but the arm warmer <b>310</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9-12</figref> includes a different reinforcement arrangement and does not include the adjustable zipper arrangement. With particular reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, in this embodiment, the arm warmer device includes a plurality of reinforcement bands <b>312</b>. The reinforcement bands <b>312</b> are provided on the sleeve <b>322</b> to help hold the sleeve <b>322</b> on the shoulder of the user while still allowing for mobility. The reinforcement bands <b>312</b> are generally comprised of a relatively heavy material that adds weight to the sleeve <b>322</b> and stabilizes the sleeve by providing a shell-like effect on the outer surface of the sleeve <b>322</b>. In at least one embodiment, the reinforcement supports may be comprised of heavy duty ballistic nylon, TPU, or similar material. In another exemplary embodiment, the reinforcement bands <b>312</b> may be comprised of a natural or synthetic rubber material. The reinforcement bands <b>312</b> may be formed by any of various processes such as compression molding. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9-12</figref>, the reinforcement bands <b>312</b> are covered with a decorative feature such as nubuck leather.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">One or more hinges <b>314</b> may be used in association with the reinforcement bands <b>312</b> on the arm warmer <b>310</b>. Each hinge <b>314</b> allows the generally rigid reinforcement bands <b>312</b> to be folded in strategic locations in order to facilitate collapse of the arm warmer <b>310</b>. For example, in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, radial reinforcement band <b>312</b><i>b </i>extends between lateral reinforcement band <b>312</b><i>a </i>and medial reinforcement band <b>312</b><i>c </i>on the shoulder portion <b>342</b> of the arm warmer <b>310</b>. A hinge <b>314</b> is positioned on the radial reinforcement band <b>312</b><i>b</i>.

<p id="p-0092" num="0091">With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16-19</figref>, yet another alternative embodiment of the arm warmer <b>510</b> is shown. In this embodiment, the arm warmer <b>510</b> includes a single arm <b>520</b> and a torso portion <b>550</b>. Similar to the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref>, the single arm <b>520</b> includes a sleeve <b>522</b> having a wrist end <b>524</b> and a shoulder end <b>540</b>. The wrist end <b>524</b> includes an interior cuff <b>526</b> and an exterior cuff <b>528</b>. The exterior cuff <b>528</b> generally extends over and covers the interior cuff <b>526</b> at the end <b>524</b> of the sleeve <b>522</b>. The exterior cuff <b>528</b> is shown in partial transparency in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> to show placement of the interior cuff <b>526</b> relative to the exterior cuff <b>528</b>. The interior cuff <b>526</b> is generally comprised of an elastic material that expands to allow the wearer's hand to pass through and contracts to hold closely to the wearer's wrist. Accordingly, the elastic interior cuff <b>526</b> acts to retain heat within the sleeve by closing around the wrist of the wearer and preventing heat from escaping at the end of the sleeve <b>522</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">The sleeve <b>522</b> is generally comprised of a fabric material that is capable of retaining heat and providing a warming effect to the athlete's arm and shoulder. Accordingly, the sleeve <b>522</b> may be comprised of a knit, woven, or non-woven construction, or a combination of such constructions. For example, the sleeve may be comprised of a quilted polyester material with padding included in quilted pockets to provide an insulating effect. As another example, the sleeve may include a two-layer construction where two different fabrics are combined to provide the desired effect. In such a two-layer construction, an inner layer closest to the skin may be used to wick moisture away from the skin. An outer layer may be used to provide warmth to the wearer's arm. In at least one embodiment, a layer of fabric comprised of a heat reflecting material may be used to provide a warming effect to the athlete's arm and shoulder.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16 and 17</figref>, the sleeve <b>522</b> includes a quilted lateral side <b>532</b> with a mesh inset on a medial side <b>534</b>. As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, the quilted lateral side <b>532</b> includes a first layer <b>536</b> of a polyester material and a second layer <b>538</b> of a double-knit microfiber material with padding <b>530</b> provided between the first layer <b>536</b> and the second layer <b>538</b>.

The medial side <b>534</b> of the sleeve <b>522</b> extends in a longitudinal direction on the sleeve from an armpit area to the cuff end <b>524</b> along the portion of the sleeve <b>522</b> closest to the torso of the wearer. The medial side <b>534</b> is comprised of a mesh material or other breathable fabric. Accordingly, the medial side <b>534</b> acts as a vent in the sleeve that prevents sweat build up and allows air to move within the sleeve <b>522</b>. In at least one embodiment, a removable outer cover is provided on the vent. The cover may be removably positioned over the vent <b>34</b> using any of various fastening techniques recognized by those of skill in the art, such as a zipper. In one embodiment, the vent cover may be a zip-off or zip-back-and-tuck arrangement, where the mesh vent can be exposed in the warmer summer months and closed in the cooler months. In yet another possible embodiment, a single zip may be provided along the length of the sleeve, wherein the vent is exposed when the zipper is opened under tension to provide a breathable, stand-alone window in the sleeve.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, a thumb hole <b>529</b> may be provided somewhere on the sleeve <b>522</b>, such as the exterior cuff <b>528</b>. The thumb hole <b>529</b> is configured to receive the thumb of the wearer, and assist the wearer in removing or donning the warmer device <b>510</b>. In particular, the thumb hole <b>529</b> may be grasped by the opposite hand of the wearer when the user removes his or her arm from the sleeve <b>522</b> to prevent the sleeve from turning inside-out. This thumb-hole <b>529</b> is especially useful if a compression material such as elastane is used as a fabric for the sleeve <b>522</b>. The perimeter of the thumb hole <b>529</b> may include a durable, relatively rigid or hard material, such as a plastic rim or simply a perimeter of reinforced stitching that provides a ring structure for the user to grab with his or her thumb.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">The torso portion <b>550</b> of the arm warmer <b>510</b> is connected to the arm portion <b>520</b> along the shoulder end <b>540</b> of the sleeve <b>522</b>. The torso portion <b>550</b> includes a shoulder harness <b>570</b> with a frame having an upper rim <b>552</b> and a lower rim <b>556</b>. The upper rim <b>552</b> defines a neck opening <b>554</b> configured to pass the wearer's head and encircle the neck area of the wearer. A handle <b>558</b> is provided by an opening in the torso portion <b>550</b> between the upper rim <b>552</b> and the lower rim <b>556</b> on the side of the arm warmer <b>510</b> opposite the sleeve <b>522</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, the upper rim <b>552</b> is configured to rest on the wearer's shoulders with the wearer's neck extending through the neck opening <b>554</b>. The lower rim <b>556</b> extends from a position under the wearer's throwing arm to the shoulder opposite the throwing arm without encircling the torso of the wearer below the shoulders. In other words, in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16-19</figref>, the lower rim <b>56</b> does not extend to a position under the opposite (non-throwing) arm of the wearer.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16-19</figref>, the torso portion <b>550</b> is primarily comprised of a relatively rigid plastic material, such as polyethylene. This relatively rigid construction gives the torso portion <b>550</b> significant durability and functionality. The torso portion is rigid shoulder harness <b>570</b> provides a frame member with the handle <b>558</b> formed in the frame. The handle <b>558</b> allows the arm warmer <b>510</b> to be hung from a hook and stored with other equipment, such as catcher's masks and chest protectors. At the same time, the relatively rigid torso portion <b>550</b> allows the athlete to quickly place the device <b>510</b> on his or her body by grasping the torso portion <b>550</b>, placing his or her head through the neck opening <b>554</b>, and sliding his or her arm into the arm portion <b>520</b>.</p>

In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, the chest section <b>560</b> is comprised of a different material than the shoulder harness and the rest of the torso portion <b>550</b>. For example, the chest section <b>560</b> may be comprised of a high density closed cell foam material. This foam material may be laminated over, adhered to, or otherwise connected to the rigid plastic that forms the shoulder harness <b>570</b> for the torso portion <b>550</b>. Alternatively, the foam material may be formed in a central opening defined by the torso portion. The chest section <b>560</b> may be provided primarily for aesthetic purposes in order to give the arm warmer <b>510</b> a certain look and feel. However, because the chest section <b>560</b> includes a foam material, it may also serve functional purposes, such as providing further insulating properties to the chest area, or protecting the chest from incidental impacts. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, a back section <b>562</b> similar to the chest portion <b>560</b> may also be provided on the rear of the torso portion <b>550</b>. Furthermore, although the chest section has been described as comprising a different material than the rest of the torso portion, it may also be comprised of the same material found in the rest of the torso portion or the arm portion.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">Although the torso portion <b>550</b> in the above-described embodiment is comprised of a relatively rigid plastic material, in other embodiments the torso portion <b>550</b> may be comprised primarily of a relatively flexible fabric material, similar to that of the sleeve <b>522</b>. In these embodiments, the upper rim <b>552</b> and the lower rim <b>556</b> may be formed of relatively rigid plastic rings that are retained within channels formed by the fabric hems of the torso portion <b>550</b>. In this configuration, the arm warmer <b>510</b> has less bulk and may be stored in a more compact fashion, similar to a shirt or jacket. In at least one embodiment, even though the torso portion <b>550</b> is not comprised of a plastic material, it is nevertheless comprised of a fabric material that is more substantial, stable and heavier than the cloth portions of the arm <b>520</b>. In such embodiments, fabrics may still be used that allow the device to remain lightweight and breathable around the torso of the wearer.</p>

The intermediate layer <b>930</b> is connected to the outer layer along two lateral seams extending axially along the sleeve <b>922</b>. The intermediate layer <b>930</b> is comprised of a mesh material that is highly permeable to air.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 25A and 28</figref>, the outer layer <b>932</b> of the sleeve <b>922</b> is substantially cylindrical. The outer layer <b>932</b> of the sleeve <b>922</b> is generally comprised of flexible fabric of a knit, woven, or non-woven construction, or a combination of such constructions. These fabrics may include any of various materials, such as polyester, cotton, elastane, or other fibers or combination thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">The arm warmer <b>910</b> in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 23-29</figref> further includes a zipper arrangement <b>934</b> that provides for ventilation on the sleeve <b>922</b>. As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 25A and 28</figref>, the zipper arrangement <b>934</b> may be adjusted to expose the intermediate layer <b>930</b> comprised of mesh material. This allows the user to selectively determine the amount of ventilation to be provided to the inner layer <b>924</b> and the associated arm of the wearer.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 25A and 26</figref>, the plurality of reinforcement members <b>912</b> are provided on the outer layer <b>932</b> of the sleeve <b>922</b>. These reinforcement members <b>912</b> include an upper arm support <b>916</b> and a forearm support <b>918</b>. The various reinforcement members <b>912</b> provide additional rigidity to the sleeve <b>922</b> while still allowing for user mobility. The reinforcement members <b>912</b> are generally comprised of a relatively heavy material that adds weight to the sleeve <b>922</b> and stabilizes the sleeve by providing a shell-like effect on the outer surface of the sleeve <b>922</b>. In at least one embodiment, the reinforcement members <b>912</b> may be comprised of heavy duty ballistic nylon or similar material. In another exemplary embodiment, the reinforcement members may be comprised of a natural or synthetic rubber material, ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA) or thermoplastic polyurethanes (TPU). The reinforcement members <b>912</b> may be formed by any of various processes such as compression molding.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">Embodiment with Extendable Glove</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">In at least one embodiment the arm warmer <b>910</b> described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 23-29</figref> further includes a hand covering. For example, in the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 30-32</figref>, the arm warmer <b>910</b> includes a hand covering in the form of a mitt <b>990</b> that is moveably coupled to the wrist end of the sleeve <b>922</b> by a tether <b>992</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">The mitt <b>990</b> is generally comprised of a fabric material that is flexible and capable of providing insulation around the fingers and hand of a user, allowing the user to warm his or her hand. Accordingly, the mitt <b>990</b> may be comprised of a knit or woven fabric formed from cotton, wool, polyester, or other fibers. The mitt <b>990</b> is generally provided as a bag-like structure that is closed at a distal end and open at a proximal end. The mitt <b>990</b> is configured to receive the user's fingers and a portion of the palm and opisthenar (i.e., the back of the hand) at the proximal end of the mitt. In the disclosed embodiment, the mitt <b>990</b> does not include a thumb. Thus, the wearer may choose to place his or her thumb outside of the mitt <b>990</b> when the fingers are inserted into the mitt <b>990</b>, or the user may choose to place his or her thumb into the mitt <b>990</b> along with the other fingers.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 30-32</figref>, the tether <b>992</b> is connected to the mitt <b>990</b>. In the disclosed embodiment, the tether <b>992</b> is a thin strap member having a first end <b>994</b> and a second end <b>996</b>. The first end <b>994</b> of the tether is connected to the proximal end of the mitt <b>990</b>. The tether <b>992</b> extends from the mitt <b>990</b> and through a pocket <b>982</b> formed on the outer layer <b>932</b> of the sleeve <b>922</b>. The tether <b>992</b> enters the pocket <b>982</b> at a distal opening <b>986</b> to the pocket <b>982</b> that is arranged and dimensioned to receive the mitt <b>990</b>. The tether <b>992</b> exits the pocket <b>982</b> through a slot <b>984</b> on a proximal end of the pocket <b>982</b>. The second end <b>996</b> of the tether is releasably coupled to a coupling component <b>998</b> provided on the outside of the pocket <b>982</b>. The second end <b>996</b> of the tether <b>992</b> includes a coupling component that is complimentary to the coupling component <b>998</b> on the outside of the sleeve <b>922</b>. For example, the coupling component <b>998</b> may be a magnet, and a complimentary magnet may be provided on the second end <b>996</b> of the tether <b>992</b>. As another example, the coupling component may be a loop portion of a hook-and-loop arrangement, and the second end <b>996</b> of the tether <b>992</b> may include a hook portion of the hook-and-loop arrangement. The second end of the tether <b>992</b> is enlarged relative to rest of the tether. Accordingly, the second end <b>996</b> of the tether <b>992</b> may be flared or include a tab that will not fit through the slot <b>984</b>. This prevents the tether <b>992</b> from being released from the arm portion <b>920</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref>, when the wearer wishes to use the mitt <b>990</b>, the user releases the second end <b>996</b> of the tether <b>992</b> from the coupling component <b>998</b>, and pulls the mitt <b>990</b> through the opening <b>986</b> and out of the pocket <b>982</b> in the direction of arrow <b>988</b>. As the mitt <b>990</b> is pulled out of the pocket <b>982</b>, the tether <b>992</b> is pulled through the slot <b>984</b> as indicated by arrow <b>989</b>. Because the second end <b>996</b> of the tether <b>992</b> is enlarged, the second end <b>996</b> will not pass through the slot <b>984</b>, and this limits the distance the mitt <b>990</b> may be pulled away from the pocket <b>982</b> and the wrist end of the sleeve <b>922</b>. When the mitt <b>990</b> is moved to this extended position away from the wrist end of the sleeve <b>922</b>, the user may easily insert his or her hand into the mitt <b>990</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref>, when the wearer wishes to return the mitt <b>990</b> to the pocket <b>982</b>, the user simply pulls the second end <b>996</b> of the tether <b>992</b> away from the slot <b>984</b>, as indicated by arrow <b>991</b>. As the second end <b>996</b> of the tether <b>992</b> is pulled away from the slot <b>984</b>, the tether <b>992</b> slides through the slot <b>984</b> and pocket <b>982</b>, causing the first end <b>994</b> of the tether to pull the mitt <b>990</b> in the direction of arrow <b>993</b> and into the pocket <b>982</b>. Once the mitt <b>990</b> is moved to this retracted position with the mitt <b>990</b> within the pocket <b>982</b>, the user may couple the second end <b>996</b> of the tether <b>992</b> to the coupling component <b>998</b> to secure the tether <b>992</b> in place on the sleeve <b>922</b>, and prevent the tether from flipping around during movement of the arm portion <b>920</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">While one embodiment of the arm warmer <b>910</b> with hand covering has been described above, it will be recognized that various alternative embodiments are possible. For example, in at least one embodiment, the mitt <b>990</b> may be pulled to the retracted position where it engages the sleeve by pulling the mitt through the cuff at the wrist end of the sleeve. In this embodiment, the mitt <b>990</b> may be loosely retained within the sleeve <b>922</b> or pulled into a pocket on the interior of the sleeve. As another example of an alternative embodiment, while the hand covering has been described as a mitt <b>990</b> with no thumb in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 30-32</figref>, it will be recognized that the hand covering may be provided in any of various other forms, such as a mitt with a thumb, a glove with complete fingers, a glove with partial fingers, or any of various other forms as will be recognized by those of ordinary skill in the art.</p>
<heading id="h-0009" level="1">Various Other Embodiments</heading>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">Although various embodiments of the arm warmer are described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-32</figref>, it will be recognized that numerous other embodiments are possible. For example, in another embodiment of the arm warmer, the device is configured for use on either the left arm or the right arm of the wearer. In this embodiment, the arm warmer may be reversible, such that it is configured to cover the right arm of the wearer when worn in one orientation and is configured to cover the left arm when turned inside-out and worn in the reverse orientation. Alternatively, the arm warmer may simply be substantially symmetric about a central plane, such that the arm warmer may be worn in one orientation to cover the right arm or rotated 180&#xb0; to cover the left arm.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">In at least one alternative embodiment, the arm may comprise an articulated sleeve, resulting in a bent or angled sleeve that is not substantially straight. For example, an articulated sleeve may be formed by incorporating a seam in the elbow area that provides an angled elbow portion. The angle at the elbow portion could be any of various angles to encourage the wearer to retain his or her arm in a certain position, reduce resistance and/or promote comfort. For example, the sleeve may be articulated to encourage the wearer to bend his or her arm as if it were in a sling (e.g., an articulated sleeve with a bend of about 60&#xb0; to 90&#xb0; may be used to accomplish this). Various articulation levels may be offered on different warmer devices, thus allowing the wearer to purchase a warmer device with a desired level of articulation.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">Although the present invention has been described with respect to certain preferred embodiments, it will be appreciated by those of skill in the art that other implementations and adaptations are possible. For example, although the arm warmer disclosed herein has been described in association with the sport of baseball, the described embodiments or other embodiments could be used in association with other sports. As another example, although the arm warmer has been generally described above as a one-piece device, it could also be configured as one interchangeable piece with removable parts. Moreover, there are advantages to individual advancements described herein that may be obtained without incorporating other aspects described above. Additionally, there may be advantages to combining features from various disclosed embodiments, as may be recognized by those of ordinary skill in the art. Therefore, the spirit and scope of any appended claims should not be limited to the description of the preferred embodiments contained herein.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates generally to clothing, and more specifically to garments of the type worn by medical personnel in operating rooms, and other applications.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">To create a proper working environment, medical operating rooms are usually maintained at a certain temperature which is often relatively cold to offset hot lighting, to keep stressed doctors and nurses comfortable while working, and/or to inhibit the spread of bacteria. In most hospitals, medical personnel are forbidden from bringing street clothing into the operating room. In some cases, anesthesiologists, nurses and any other personnel in the operating room who are not scrubbed in may wear a medical or hospital issue warm up jacket over their scrubs; however, these garments do not keep the wearer at a comfortable temperature. Excessive layers of garments are also counterproductive in the operating room, since they may restrict the mobility or dexterity of the personnel. On the other hand, limbs and fingers tend to get stiff when the body is cold,</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Anesthesiologists, nurse anesthetists, perioperative nurses, and others participating in the operating room need their body to be at a comfortable level of temperature and dexterity to perform their functions over many hours. Additionally, medical personnel suffering from hormonal changes often have abnormal body temperature perceptions while participating in surgery. One example is post menopausal women, who suffer from periodic drastic perceived changes in body temperature and often feel much warmer than other individuals in the same room. Also, the surgical treatment of burn patients or pediatric patients usually requires the operating or treating room to be warmer than average for the patient's benefit. These situations have created a need for alternative measures for keeping medical personnel, or other users comfortable.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The above-listed needs are met or exceeded by the present temperature regulating garment, usable in many situations when a wearer desires enhanced temperature regulation, and in particular for keeping operating room personnel at a desired temperature. A specially designed warm up jacket or vest is provided to be worn over scrubs. A version of the present garment is a specially designed vest provided to be worn over scrubs and under any sort of warm up jacket or surgical gown. In a preferred embodiment, the garment is made of a thermally insulating material, such as GORE&#xae; surgical fabric, preferably level 3 or 4. Furthermore, the present garment features at least one and preferably several pockets which are designed to releasably accommodate a temperature element such as a reusable heatable gel pack or chemical warming pack, cooling pack or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is contemplated that the size and locations of the temperature regulating elements are variable to suit the situation. The temperature regulating element can be a heating element, such as a battery-powered heating element, chemical warming pack, reusable heated gel pack or warmed up bag of IV fluid, or a cooling element, such as a phase change cooling element, chemical cooling pack, reusable cooled gel pack, refrigerated bag of IV fluid or ice packs. While preferably made of mesh material, the pockets are designed to allow the heat generated by the regulating elements to be distributed generally uniformly throughout an inside chamber defined by the present garment. The garment also features at least one single layer or double layer pocket, designed to hold a heating or cooling pack over the wearer's lumbar region. When provided as a vest, the present garment can be reversed to provide an additional layer of non-fenestrated material between the wearer and the temperature element. Such an additional layer is helpful when a cooling element is used to prevent the discomfort of localized cold upon the skin.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">There also exists a need to easily launder garments with temperature regulating elements. After placing the elements into the pockets, the user has to remove each element before placing the garment into the laundry machine. This need is met by the present temperature regulating garment, which features an inner liner panel which has pockets for the temperature regulating elements. Therefore, it is contemplated that the inner liner panel is preferably removable, and the user removes the liner panel and launders the garment. After laundering, the liner panel is reattached to the garment.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">More specifically, a garment for regulating temperature is provided, with a body including a back panel and at least one front panel and at least partially joined along at least one common edge, an inner liner panel fastened to an inner surface of at least one of the back panel and to the at least one front panel with an first surface, and a second surface opposite to the first surface of the inner liner panel, and at least one pocket with top, bottom and side edges, being fastened to at least one of the first and second surfaces of the inner liner panel. The at least one pocket has at least one side opening.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In another embodiment, a strip is provided for use with a garment for regulating temperature having a body including a back panel and at least one front panel and at least partially joined along at least one common edge, the joined panels defining an inside chamber. The strip has a cloth web having a surface, at least one removable attachment disposed on the surface of the cloth web of the strip, and at least one pocket having top, bottom, and side edges, being fastened to the surface of the cloth web of the strip on at least one said side edge of the at least one pocket, the at least one pocket having at least one side opening.</p>

<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-2</figref> and <b>4</b>, a garment for regulating temperature is generally designated <b>10</b>, and in the preferred embodiment is a jacket including a body <b>12</b> with a back panel <b>14</b>, at least one of a first front panel <b>16</b> and a second front panel <b>18</b>. The first front panel <b>16</b> is partially joined along at least one first common edge <b>20</b> shared with the back panel <b>14</b>. Likewise, the second front panel <b>18</b> is partially joined along at least one second common edge <b>22</b> shared with the back panel <b>14</b>. As is known in the art, the common edges <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> form seams. The first front panel <b>16</b> and the second front panel <b>18</b> are joinable along respective free edges <b>24</b>, <b>26</b>, preferably by fasteners <b>28</b>, such as snaps, buttons, clips, zippers, VELCRO&#xae; hook and loop fastener material, and the like. Upon assembly, the joined panels <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> and <b>18</b> combine to define an inside chamber <b>29</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">A first arm hole <b>30</b> is defined in part by an end <b>32</b> of a seam <b>34</b> formed by joining the common edges <b>20</b> of the first front panel <b>16</b> and the back panel <b>14</b>, and at an end <b>36</b> of the arm hole opposite the end <b>32</b> by a shoulder seam <b>38</b> formed by a junction of the first front panel <b>16</b> and the back panel <b>14</b>. Likewise, a second arm hole <b>40</b> is defined by an end <b>42</b> of a second seam <b>44</b> formed by joining the common edges <b>22</b> of the second front panel <b>18</b> and the back panel <b>14</b>, and at an end <b>46</b> of the arm hole <b>40</b> opposite the end <b>42</b> by a shoulder seam <b>48</b> formed by a junction of the second front panel <b>18</b> and the back panel <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">A first sleeve <b>50</b> and a second sleeve <b>52</b> are optionally affixed respectively to the first and second arm holes <b>30</b>, <b>40</b>. Preferably, the body <b>12</b>, and if provided, the sleeves, <b>50</b>, <b>52</b> of the garment <b>10</b> are made of GORE&#xae; surgical fabric, level 3 or 4, but alternate embodiments are contemplated where the body is made of any thermally insulating, synthetic, non-linting medically acceptable textile, including, but not limited to polyester fabric, cotton polyester fabric, surgical fabric, nylon or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the garment <b>10</b> is depicted in an open position such that an inner surface <b>54</b> of the back panel <b>14</b>, an inner surface <b>56</b> of the first front panel <b>16</b>, and an inner surface <b>58</b> of the second front panel <b>18</b> are shown. A first pocket <b>60</b> dimensioned for accommodating a temperature regulating element <b>62</b> is fastened to the inner or interior surface <b>56</b> of the first front panel <b>16</b> approximately 10-15 centimeters from a bottom edge or hem <b>64</b> of the first front panel to a bottom edge <b>65</b> of the pocket and approximately 4 centimeters from a side edge <b>66</b> of the first front panel <b>16</b> to an adjacent pocket edge <b>67</b>. A third pocket <b>68</b>, preferably smaller than the first pocket <b>60</b>, is fastened to an outer or exterior surface <b>70</b> of the first pocket <b>60</b>. As an alternative, the third pocket <b>68</b>, is directly fastened to the inner surface <b>56</b> of the first front panel <b>16</b>, and therefore lies inside the first pocket <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Likewise, a second pocket <b>72</b> dimensioned for accommodating the temperature regulating element <b>62</b> is fastened to an inner surface <b>58</b> of the second front panel <b>18</b> approximately 10-15 centimeters from a bottom edge or hem <b>76</b> of the second front panel <b>18</b> to a bottom pocket edge <b>77</b> and approximately 4 centimeters from a side edge <b>78</b> of the second front panel <b>18</b> to an adjacent pocket edge <b>79</b>. A fourth pocket <b>80</b>, preferably smaller than the second pocket <b>72</b>, is fastened to an outer or exterior surface <b>82</b> of the second pocket <b>72</b>. As an alternative, a fourth pocket <b>80</b>, is directly fastened to the inner surface <b>58</b> of the second front panel <b>18</b>, and therefore lies inside the second pocket <b>72</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The preferred dimension of the first and the second pockets <b>60</b>, <b>72</b> is 25 cm deep or tall, and 20 cm wide. These pockets <b>60</b>, <b>72</b> are sized to accommodate a larger temperature regulating element <b>62</b>, including but not limited to IV fluid bags, but may also hold a smaller temperature regulating element such as a chemical warming pack. The preferred dimensions of the third and fourth pockets <b>68</b>, <b>80</b> are 12 cm deep or tall and 16 cm wide. The bottom edge <b>65</b> of the first pocket <b>60</b> and the bottom edge <b>77</b> of the second pocket <b>72</b> are preferably located 13 cm from bottom edges <b>88</b>, <b>89</b> of the third and fourth pockets <b>68</b>, <b>80</b>, respectively. These pockets <b>68</b>, <b>80</b> are sized to accommodate a smaller temperature regulating element <b>62</b>, such as a chemical warming pack. For the purposes of this application, the above-identified combinations of the first and third pockets <b>60</b> and <b>68</b>, and the second and fourth pockets <b>72</b> and <b>80</b> will also be referred to as double pockets.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a fifth pocket <b>90</b> and a sixth pocket <b>92</b> for accommodating a temperature regulating element <b>62</b> are fastened to the inner surface <b>54</b> of the back panel <b>14</b> approximately 20-25 cm from a bottom edge <b>94</b> of the back panel to a bottom edge <b>95</b> of the pockets. Advantageously, the fifth and sixth pockets <b>90</b>, <b>92</b> are placed over a wearer's lumbar region to direct the temperature regulating element <b>62</b> over this body region. Accordingly, the preferred dimension of each of the fifth and sixth pockets <b>90</b>, <b>92</b> is 12-25 cm deep or tall and 16-20 cm wide. In the preferred embodiment, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the pockets <b>90</b> and <b>92</b> are separated by a seam <b>96</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the seam <b>96</b> is omitted, leaving only a single pocket <b>90</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">It is contemplated that at least one of the pockets <b>60</b>, <b>68</b>, <b>72</b>, <b>80</b>, <b>90</b> and <b>92</b> may have one of the temperature regulating elements <b>62</b> disposed inside of them at any given time. The location, dimensions, and design of the pockets <b>60</b>, <b>68</b>, <b>72</b>, <b>80</b>, <b>90</b> and <b>92</b> may vary from the above description to suit the application, provided that the pockets are constructed and arranged for allowing the heat or cooling from the temperature regulating element <b>62</b> to escape into the interior chamber <b>29</b> and this chamber is thus insulated from ambient temperature in the room, usually an operating room. Thus, the user will employ the type of temperature regulating element(s) <b>62</b> as needed to achieve a desired temperature within the interior chamber that has a perceived differential from the ambient temperature of the room. It is to be understood that this desired temperature varies with the individual and the circumstances of the application.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The garment <b>10</b> is preferably made of a non-linting, temperature insulating textile which can withstand multiple industrial or hospital launderings. Advantageously, the preferred material maintains the temperature within the inside chamber <b>29</b>. In the preferred embodiment, the pockets <b>60</b>, <b>72</b>, <b>68</b>, <b>80</b>, <b>90</b>, and <b>92</b> of the garment <b>10</b> are made of polyester fabric, preferably mesh which allows for enhanced conductivity of the desired temperature in the inside chamber <b>29</b>. However, in other embodiments, the pockets <b>60</b>, <b>72</b>, <b>68</b>, <b>80</b>, <b>90</b>, <b>92</b>, can be made of other textiles.

        "abstract": "The regulation of glycogen synthase activity by bile acids in primary hepatocytes and in the intact liver was investigated. Bile acids (deoxycholic acid, DCA; taurocholic acid, TCA) activated AKT and glycogen synthase (GS) in primary rat hepatocytes. Incubation with a phosphatidyl inositol-3 kinase inhibitor or expression of dominant-negative AKT in primary rat hepatocytes abolished activation of AKT and GS by DCA and TCA. TCA, but not DCA, activated Galpha(i) proteins in primary rat hepatocytes. Treatment of cells with pertussis toxin or expression of dominant-negative Galpha(i) blocked TCA-induced activation of AKT and of GS but did not alter AKT or GS activation caused by DCA. TCA caused activation of AKT and GS in intact rat liver. Expression of dominant-negative Galpha(i) reduced TCA-induced activation of AKT and of GS in intact rat liver. Together, our findings demonstrate that bile acids are physiological regulators of glycogen synthase in rat liver and that conjugated bile acids use a Galpha(i)-coupled G protein-coupled receptor to regulate GS activity in vitro and in vivo.",

        "abstract": "Obesity is a risk factor for impaired physical function and disability, with the degree of impairment most compromised in extreme obesity. Mild-to-moderate weight loss has been shown to improve function in older adults. The impact of laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery on weight loss and physical function in morbidly obese individuals was assessed. This longitudinal, observational study followed up 28 morbidly obese men and women (body mass index &gt; or = 40.0 kg/m(2)) for 12 months after laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. Physical function (self-report using the Fitness Arthritis and Seniors Trial disability questionnaire; performance tasks using the Short Physical Performance Battery and a lateral mobility task); strength (maximal isometric knee torque); and body composition measured using bioelectrical impedance were determined before surgery (baseline) and at 3 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months after surgery. The 12-month weight loss was 34.2% (excess weight loss 59.8%), with a mean fat mass loss of 46 kg and a loss of fat free mass of 6.6 kg. The performance tasks and self-reported questionnaire scores had improved by 3 months after surgery compared with baseline, with selected measures showing less impairment and disability in as few as 3 weeks after surgery. Muscle quality, as measured using the maximal torque per kilogram body weight, was greater at 6 months than at baseline. The results of our study have shown that in morbidly obese individuals with a high risk of mobility impairments, surgical procedures to reduce body weight increase mobility and improve performance of daily activities in as few as 3 weeks after gastric bypass surgery.",

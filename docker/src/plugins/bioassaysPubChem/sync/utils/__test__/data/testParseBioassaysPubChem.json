          "Alkaline phosphatases (EC 3.1.3.1) (APs) catalyze the hydrolysis of phosphomonoesters, releasing phosphate and alcohol. APs are dimeric enzymes found in the most organisms. In human, four isozymes of APs have been identified. Three isozymes are tissue-specific and the fourth one is tissue-non specific, named TNAP. TNAP deficiency is associated with defective bone mineralization in the form of rickets and osteomalacia. Therefore, there is therapeutic potential of modulating TNAP activity. ",
          "",
          "The goal of this HTS is to identify novel and specific activators of TNAP. The only known to date class of alkaline phosphatases activators are amino-containing alcohols, such as diethanolamine (DEA), that act as phosphoacceptor substrate and exhibit its effect in high-mM concentration range. Compounds with a similar mode of action are expected to demonstrate diminished stimulating potential if tested in the presence of DEA. Therefore, for detection of compounds with diverse mode of action, the HTS assay was optimized and HTS campaigns were performed in the presence and in the absence of DEA. The current AID reports a set of the data from screening in the absence of DEA or any other phosphate acceptor. ",

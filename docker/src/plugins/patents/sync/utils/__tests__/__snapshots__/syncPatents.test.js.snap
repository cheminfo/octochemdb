    "abstract": "The present invention is to provide glass exhibiting both of a low thermal expansion and a low-temperature melting property and to provide glass which is able to be manufactured under the condition where an average linear thermal expantion coefficient at 0° C. to 50° C. is preferably not less than 40×10 −7 ° C. −1 , more preferably 35×10 −7 ° C. −1  and, most preferably, 33×10 −7 ° C. −1  and a fusing temperature is preferably not higher than 1550° C., more preferably not higher than 1540° C. and, most preferably, not higher than 1530° C. The means therefor is the glass, characterized in that, where an average linear thermal expantion coefficient at 0° C. to 50° C. is not more than 40×10 −7 ° C. −1 , an Al 2 O 3  component and a B 2 O 3  component on the basis of oxides are contained and the ratio of B 2 O 3 /Al 2 O 3  in terms of % by mass is not less than 0.8.",

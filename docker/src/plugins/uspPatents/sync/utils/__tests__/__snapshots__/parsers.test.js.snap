    "abstract": "The invention provides a solvent mixture comprising n-propyl bromide, a mixture of low boiling solvents and, preferably, a defluxing and/or ionics removing additive and/or at least one saturated terpene. The invention also provides a method of cleaning an article (e.g., an electrical, plastic, or metal part) in a vapor degreaser using the solvent mixture. The solvent mixture of the invention is non-flammable, non-corrosive, and non-hazardous. In addition, it has a high solvency and a very low ozone depletion potential. Thus, using the solvent mixture of the invention, oil, grease, rosin flux, and other organic material can be readily removed from the article of interest in an environmentally safe manner.",

The reversible crown includes cooperating attachment members located on the inside non-focal surfaces of the first and second major opposing surfaces, providing the base for attaching, detaching and reattaching the removable and reversible single or dual visor. The detachable and reversible single visor has first and second major opposing surfaces along with cooperating attachment members to used to attach, detach and reattach itself to the reversible crown. The dual visor also has first and second major opposing surfaces with cooperating attachment members to attach, detach and reattach to the reversible crown. The visor and crown are easily removable and reversible to include one major surface each being displayed upwardly during wear and accounts for many different headwear assembly looks as well as having the reversible crown worn alone.",

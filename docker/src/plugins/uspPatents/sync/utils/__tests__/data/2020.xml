<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present patent application relates to lawn and garden equipment, and, more particularly, to a rotary tiller having a transmission and drive system at least partially disposed within a cylindrical drum.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Several types of rotary tillers exist for performing various tilling operations in gardens, flowerbeds, lawns, or the like. Examples of these types include rear tine SRT (&#x201c;standard rotating tine&#x201d;) tillers, rear tine CRT (&#x201c;counter rotating tine&#x201d;) tillers, and front tine tillers, also commonly referred to as cultivators. While each of these devices is capable of tilling the earth, each particular construction can be optimized for discrete operating conditions or operations.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Rotary tillers generally include a series of tines which are mounted on a single horizontal tiller shaft and rotated in order to provide a slicing action in which the tines cut through the soil. Many rotary tillers provide power and rotation to the tiller shaft through a worm drive. In worm drive systems, a motor drive shaft includes a worm portion that is configured to engage a worm gear extending around and coupled to the tiller shaft. In operation, rotation of the motor drive shaft is transferred to the tiller shaft through the interaction of the worm and the worm gear. Worm gear drives are popular because they allow for a significant reduction in rotational speed, while also allowing a higher torque to be transmitted to the tiller shaft.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Conventional, high-reduction worm drive rotary tillers are inefficient. In the past, efficiency of the worm drive gearbox was not a concern because rotary tillers are typically heavy pieces of gas powered equipment with a replenishable fuel source. However, if a compact, lightweight tiller is desired that operates on a limited power supply, such as a battery, the run time of the rotary tiller can be severely inhibited by the inefficiency of the gearbox.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Current rotary tillers that incorporate a worm drive reduction on the tine shaft leave an untilled strip in the center of the tilling path because the worm shaft that transmits power to the worm gear on the tine shaft cannot interfere with the tines as they rotate. Therefore, the depth of the cut made by the tines is limited by the existence of the uncut strip of soil coming into contact with the transmission housing. Rotary tillers that incorporate a chain drive reduction rather than a worm drive reduction on the tine shaft also leave an untilled strip in the center of the tilling path for similar reasons. Alternatively, chain drive reductions can be located on either end of the tine shaft. However, when this style of reduction is used, the tine hood and the chain reduction create obstacles that also limit the depth of the cut.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">As discussed above, many tiller worm drives utilize large gear reductions with small diameter tine shafts to reduce rotational speed and increase torque. However, several problems relating to vegetation can occur with such a configuration. For example, vegetation commonly wraps around the small tine shaft very tightly because the small tine shaft has a large mechanical advantage. Additionally, the portion of the motor drive shaft that is exposed to the vegetation creates a location for the stationary surfaces of the rotary tiller to hold the vegetation while the rotating tines and tine shaft tightly wind the vegetation. This condition is generally compounded by the presence of bolts protruding from both the transmission and the tine shaft, as well as the presence of tines on either side of the transmission that grab the same vegetation and bend it around both sides of the transmission simultaneously. Additionally, when dealing with high reduction worm drives, the tine shaft is difficult to move by human power when the rotary tiller is powered down. In this case, the tines may need to be removed prior to unwinding the vegetation.</p>

<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The present patent application relates to rotary tiller systems and methods for tilling gardens, flowerbeds, lawns, and other ground surfaces.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> is a side view of a rotary tiller <b>10</b> in accordance with an example of the present disclosure. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, the rotary tiller <b>10</b> can generally include a frame <b>12</b>, a drive system <b>13</b> including a battery <b>15</b> (among other components, discussed in detail below), one or more tines <b>16</b> rotatably mounted on the frame <b>12</b> and configured to be driven by the drive system <b>13</b>, and a cover <b>17</b> configured to at least partially cover one or more components of the rotary tiller <b>10</b> including the battery <b>15</b>. The rotary tiller <b>10</b> can also include a tine hood assembly <b>18</b> coupled to the frame <b>12</b> and configured to surround at least a portion of the tines <b>16</b>. The tine hood assembly <b>18</b> can define an inlet <b>19</b> and a discharge <b>20</b>. Tilled soil, rocks, or the like can be received within the inlet <b>19</b> and redistributed to the ground through the discharge <b>19</b> during a tilling operation. One or more wheels <b>21</b> can be coupled to at least one of the frame <b>12</b> and the tine hood assembly <b>18</b> to allow a user to move the rotary tiller <b>10</b> between desired locations. Particularly, the position of the rotary tiller <b>10</b> can be adjustable between a travel position, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, in which the one or more wheels <b>21</b> can engage a ground surface G with the tines <b>16</b> spaced apart from the ground surface G, and a tilling position as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, in which the tines <b>16</b> can engage the ground surface G and the one or more wheels <b>21</b> are spaced apart from the ground surface G. The two alternate positions allow a user to easily transport the rotary tiller <b>10</b> between tilling locations while maintaining a high level of tilling performance.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>, the rotary tiller <b>10</b> can include a handle assembly <b>22</b> extending from the frame <b>12</b>. In an example, the handle assembly <b>22</b> can include a first longitudinally extending shaft <b>24</b> and a second longitudinally extending shaft <b>26</b>. As further illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>, the first and second longitudinally extending shafts <b>24</b> and <b>26</b> can have first and second angled grip portions <b>28</b> and <b>30</b>, respectively, extending from upper ends thereof. In an example, the first and second angled grip portions <b>28</b> and <b>30</b> can be configured as &#x201c;pistol-type grips,&#x201d; as will be discussed in further detail below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The frame <b>12</b> of the rotary tiller <b>10</b> can be pivotably coupled to an axle <b>32</b> extending between the wheels <b>21</b>. The axle <b>32</b> can be fixedly coupled to the wheels <b>21</b> to allow simultaneous rotation of both wheels <b>21</b> during transport of the rotary tiller <b>10</b>. The pivotable coupling allows, among other components, the frame <b>12</b>, the tines <b>16</b>, the tine hood assembly <b>18</b>, and the handle assembly <b>22</b> to be rotated with respect to the wheels <b>21</b> and the axle <b>32</b>. Thus, when the rotary tiller <b>10</b> is in the travel position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, the user can rotate the handle assembly <b>22</b> in a direction A to lower the handle assembly <b>22</b> toward the ground surface G, which in turn raises the tines <b>16</b> further away from the ground surface G in order to, for example, avoid obstacles that might interfere with the tines <b>16</b>. Conversely, the user can rotate the handle assembly <b>22</b> in a direction B to raise the handle assembly <b>22</b> away from the ground surface G, which in turn lowers the tines <b>16</b> toward the ground surface G. Thus, by moving the handle assembly <b>22</b> in the directions A and B, users of different heights can find an appropriate and comfortable position for the handle assembly <b>22</b> relative to the ground surface G. In order to adjust the rotary tiller <b>10</b> from the travel position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> to the tilling position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, the user can continue to rotate the handle assembly <b>22</b>, by at least one of a pushing action or a pulling action, until the tines <b>16</b> are engaged with the ground surface G as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>. In the tilling position, the rotary tiller <b>10</b> can be operated such that the drive system <b>13</b> rotates the tines <b>16</b>, causing the ground surface G to be pulverized and cultivated, for example, in preparation for planting flowers, crops, or the like in soil.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In an alternative example, a separate axle <b>32</b> can be provided for each of the wheels <b>21</b>. In yet another alternative example, the axle <b>32</b> can be fixedly coupled to the frame <b>12</b> with the wheels <b>21</b> being rotatably coupled to the axle <b>32</b>, such as with one or more roller bearings. In this example, when the handle assembly <b>22</b> is rotated in directions A and B, the wheels <b>21</b> act as the pivot points about which the remaining components of the rotary tiller <b>10</b> rotate. Regardless of the configuration of the axle <b>32</b> and the wheels <b>21</b>, the frame <b>12</b> can remain pivotable with respect to the wheels <b>21</b> when the rotary tiller <b>10</b> is in the travel position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> with the wheels <b>21</b> on the ground surface G.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">As further illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>, the first and second longitudinally extending shafts <b>24</b> and <b>26</b> of the handle assembly <b>22</b> can be coupled to the frame <b>12</b> or side shields of the rotary tiller <b>10</b> with handle brackets <b>27</b> (only the handle bracket <b>27</b> associated with the first longitudinally extending shaft <b>24</b> being shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>). In an example, the handle brackets <b>27</b> can be adjustable in directions C and D such that the position of the handle assembly <b>22</b> can be further adjusted according to the preferences of the user.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref> is a perspective view of a control system <b>29</b> that can be provided on the handle assembly <b>22</b> for controlling operation of the drive system <b>13</b>, in accordance with an example of the present disclosure. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>, the first and second angled grip portions <b>28</b> and <b>30</b> can include first and second control handles <b>31</b> and <b>33</b>, respectively. The first control handle <b>31</b> can include a first actuation mechanism, such as a first trigger <b>35</b>. Similarly, the second control handle <b>33</b> can include a second actuation mechanism, such as a second trigger <b>37</b>. The first and second control handles <b>31</b> and <b>33</b> can be communicatively coupled to the drive system <b>13</b> with a pair of control cables <b>39</b>. The control cables <b>39</b> can be routed through an aperture <b>41</b> located in one of the first and second longitudinally extending shafts <b>24</b> and <b>26</b> of the handle assembly <b>22</b> to avoid interference with the user during transport or operation.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">With further reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>, one of the triggers <b>35</b>, <b>37</b> can be configured as a safety mechanism while the other one of the triggers <b>35</b>, <b>37</b> can be configured to control operation of the drive system <b>13</b>. In an example, the user must first actuate one of the triggers <b>35</b>, <b>37</b> to disengage a safety lockout feature. Once the safety lockout feature is disengaged, the user can actuate the other one of the triggers <b>35</b>, <b>37</b> to initiate operation of the rotary tiller <b>10</b>. Thus, in this example, the user cannot accidentally initiate operation of the rotary tiller <b>10</b> by actuating only one of the triggers <b>35</b>, <b>37</b>. However, alternative examples of the control system <b>29</b> can include only a single trigger or actuation mechanism to initiate operation of the rotary tiller <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref> are alternative front perspective views of the rotary tiller <b>10</b> in the tilling position with the wheels <b>21</b> raised above the tines <b>16</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>, the tines <b>16</b> can be coupled to or formed integral with a drum <b>34</b>. The drum <b>34</b> can be, but is not necessarily, cylindrical in shape. The drum <b>34</b> can be configured to extend substantially between a first side shield <b>40</b> and a second side shield <b>42</b> of the tine hood assembly <b>18</b>. The second side shield <b>42</b> can include a bearing plate <b>44</b> configured to receive an output shaft of the drive system <b>13</b> for driving rotation of the drum <b>34</b> and tines <b>16</b> relative to the tine hood assembly <b>18</b>, as discussed in further detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">As further illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>, the handle assembly <b>22</b> can include one or more crossbar support members <b>46</b> extending between the first longitudinally extending shaft <b>24</b> and the second longitudinally extending shaft <b>26</b>. Although two such crossbar support members <b>46</b> are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>, any number of crossbar support members <b>46</b> is possible. Furthermore, the crossbar support members <b>46</b> are shown as extending in a direction generally perpendicular to the directions of the first and second longitudinally extending shafts <b>24</b> and <b>26</b> merely for purposes of example and not limitation. However, the crossbar support members <b>46</b> can intersect the first and second longitudinally extending shafts <b>24</b> and <b>26</b> at any desired angle. In an example, a pair of crossbar support members <b>46</b> can be positioned such that they overlap each other in the space formed between the first and second longitudinally extending shafts <b>24</b> and <b>26</b>, thereby creating a substantially &#x201c;X-shaped&#x201d; configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The first longitudinally extending shaft <b>24</b> of the handle assembly <b>22</b> can comprise a plurality of shaft sections, such as shaft sections <b>24</b>A-C. Similarly, the second longitudinally extending shaft <b>26</b> of the handle assembly <b>22</b> can comprise a plurality of shaft sections, such as shaft sections <b>26</b>A-C. In an example, the shaft sections <b>24</b>A-C and the shaft sections <b>26</b>A-C can be telescopically coupled such that the handle assembly <b>22</b> can be retracted, which can allow for easier transport and storage. In another example, the shaft sections <b>24</b>A-C and the shaft sections <b>26</b>A-C can be hinged such that the handle assembly <b>22</b> can be collapsed.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a front view of the rotary tiller <b>10</b> in the tilling position. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the tine hood assembly <b>18</b> can include an opening <b>50</b> that is sized and configured to receive and allow rotation of the drum <b>34</b> and the tines <b>16</b> extending therefrom. Each of the tines <b>16</b> can include a plurality of blades <b>52</b> configured for cutting through and cultivating the ground. The tines <b>16</b> can be configured such that at least two or more of the blades <b>52</b> of a particular tine <b>16</b> extend in generally opposing directions. In an example, the blades <b>52</b> of a particular tine <b>16</b> can form an alternating configuration where all even numbered blades <b>52</b> extend in a first direction toward the rotary tiller <b>10</b> and all odd numbered blades <b>52</b> extend in a second direction away from the rotary tiller <b>10</b>, as generally depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The inverted configuration of the tines <b>16</b> can keep material from accumulating on the blades <b>52</b>. The outwardly facing blades <b>52</b> can be configured to perform a large percentage of the cutting. The tines <b>16</b> can work together to dig into the ground aggressively, while moving the material away from the tines <b>16</b> to avoid clogging of the rotary tiller <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In operation, the tines <b>16</b> extending from the drum <b>34</b> can be configured for forward rotation and/or backward rotation. As the tines <b>16</b> are rotating in the direction selected by the user, the user can steer the rotary tiller <b>10</b> by holding onto the first and second grip portions <b>28</b> and <b>30</b> of the handle assembly <b>22</b>. Thus, the forward or backward propulsion of the rotary tiller <b>10</b> can be provided by the tines <b>16</b> digging into the ground and pulling the rotary tiller <b>10</b> forward or pushing the rotary tiller <b>10</b> backward. In addition to rotating the tines <b>16</b> (via the drum <b>34</b>), the drive system <b>13</b> can also be configured to rotate the wheels <b>21</b> in self-propelled rotary tiller examples.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The rotary tiller <b>10</b> shown and described herein includes five tines <b>16</b> merely for purposes of example and not limitation. Rotary tillers having any number of tines <b>16</b> greater than or equal to two are contemplated and within the intended scope of the present disclosure. Furthermore, the size of the tines <b>16</b> and the configuration of the blades <b>52</b>, including the number of blades <b>52</b> provided on the tines <b>16</b>, need not be uniform.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">As further illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the tine <b>16</b> adjacent to the first side shield <b>40</b> of the tine hood assembly <b>18</b> can be sized and configured such that at least one of the blades <b>52</b> extends outside of the tine hood assembly <b>18</b> past the first side shield <b>40</b>. Similarly, the tine <b>16</b> adjacent to the second side shield <b>42</b> of the tine hood assembly <b>18</b> can be sized and configured such that at least one of the blades <b>52</b> extends outside of the tine hood assembly <b>18</b> past the second side shield <b>42</b>. Providing a tine cutting width T that is greater than a width H of a bottom side of the tine hood assembly <b>18</b> can help prevent the rotary tiller <b>10</b> from becoming hung up on untilled ground adjacent to the rotary tiller <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The discharge <b>20</b> of the tine hood assembly <b>18</b> can also include a first stepped side tunnel <b>54</b> and a second stepped side tunnel <b>56</b>. The first stepped side tunnel <b>54</b> and the second stepped side tunnel <b>56</b> can define an enlarged opening at the discharge <b>20</b> of the tine hood assembly <b>18</b> as compared to the inlet <b>19</b>. During a tilling operation, ground material such as soil, rocks and other debris can get caught up within the tine hood assembly <b>18</b>, which can clog or otherwise impede the passage of the ground material through the rotary tiller <b>10</b>. In an example, the first stepped side tunnel <b>54</b> and the second stepped side tunnel <b>56</b> can be defined, at least in part, by the first side shield <b>40</b> and the second side shield <b>42</b>, respectively. The first and second stepped side tunnels <b>54</b> and <b>56</b> can have any suitable shape that allows for improved passage of ground material. In an example, the first stepped side tunnel <b>54</b> can include a first angled tunnel surface <b>58</b> and the second stepped side tunnel <b>56</b> can include a second angled tunnel surface <b>60</b>. The first and second angled tunnel surfaces <b>58</b> and <b>60</b> can be configured to assist with the passage of ground material by redirecting the ground material out through the discharge <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is an exploded perspective view of the rotary tiller <b>10</b> with the handle assembly <b>22</b> removed. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the drive system <b>13</b> can further include an electric motor <b>72</b>, a transmission such as a planetary gearbox <b>74</b> having a gearbox output shaft <b>76</b>, and an extension shaft <b>78</b> configured to be coupled to the gearbox output shaft <b>76</b> on a first end <b>80</b> and to the drum <b>34</b> on a second end <b>82</b>. Particularly, the gearbox output shaft <b>76</b> can be sized such that it can be received within an internal portion of the extension shaft <b>78</b>. The gearbox output shaft <b>76</b> can include a channel <b>73</b> that can be configured to align with a pair of apertures <b>75</b> adjacent to the first end <b>80</b> of the extension shaft <b>78</b>. When properly aligned, a suitable fastening means such as a bolt <b>77</b> can be inserted through the apertures <b>75</b> and the channel <b>73</b> to secure the gearbox output shaft <b>76</b> to the extension shaft <b>78</b>. In an example, one or more of the channel <b>73</b> and the apertures <b>75</b> can be internally threaded so as to engage a threaded external portion of the bolt <b>77</b>. In a further example, the bolt <b>77</b> can be inserted through the apertures <b>75</b> and the channel <b>73</b>, and subsequently secured in place with a nut or other complementary fastening member. Rather than being formed as a separate component, in various examples, the extension shaft <b>78</b> can form a part of the gearbox output shaft <b>76</b>. The extension shaft <b>78</b> can be coupled to the drum <b>34</b> in any suitable manner. In an example, the drum <b>34</b> can include a key member that can be configured for receipt within a keyway <b>79</b> defined in the extension shaft <b>78</b> near the second end <b>82</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The structure and operation of the planetary gearbox <b>74</b> will be described in further detail below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>. However, in general, planetary gearboxes can include one or more outer gears, or planet gears, that mesh with and revolve around a central, or sun gear. Typically, the axes of the gears are parallel to one another. In various examples, several sets of planet gears and sun gears can be &#x201c;stacked&#x201d; in series in order to produce a desired output of the planetary gearbox. Planetary gearboxes can be advantageous over other types of transmission systems due to their compactness, low efficiency loss, and increased torque distribution.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The battery <b>15</b> can be operably coupled to the electric motor <b>72</b> through a battery connector <b>84</b> and one or more cables (not shown). In an example, the battery <b>15</b> can be a lithium battery, such as a 20 Volt lithium battery. Other types of batteries that can be used include, but are not limited to, Ni-cad batteries and lead acid batteries. Furthermore, the battery can provide any suitable voltage, such as between about 12 Volts and about 48 Volts. The drive system <b>13</b> can also include an electronic motor controller <b>86</b> for controlling the electric motor <b>72</b>. In various examples, the motor controller <b>86</b> can include a manual or automatic means for starting and stopping the electric motor <b>72</b>, selecting forward or reverse rotation of the drum <b>34</b>, selecting and regulating the speed, regulating or limiting the torque, and protecting against overloads and/or faults. Furthermore, the motor controller <b>86</b> can include control circuitry in the form of analog or digital input signals.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">As further illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the tine hood assembly <b>18</b> can further include a tine shield <b>88</b> configured to extend between the first side shield <b>40</b> and the second side shield <b>42</b>. In an example, the tine shield <b>88</b> can be formed as a curved planar surface that defines at least a portion of the inlet <b>19</b> and the discharge <b>20</b> of the tine hood assembly <b>18</b>. The tine shield <b>88</b> can be secured to the first side shield <b>40</b> and the second side shield <b>42</b> using any suitable fastening means including, but not limited to, bolts, screws, rivets, welding, or the like. Alternatively, the tine shield <b>88</b> can be formed integral with the first side shield <b>40</b> and/or the second side shield <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">As discussed above, the frame <b>12</b> of the rotary tiller <b>10</b> can be rotatably coupled to the wheels <b>21</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the frame <b>12</b> can include one or more wheel mounts <b>89</b> extending therefrom. In an example, each of the one or more wheel mounts <b>89</b> can include an aperture <b>90</b> configure to allow passage of the axle <b>32</b>. The wheels <b>21</b> can be fixedly coupled to the ends of the axle <b>32</b>, and the one or more apertures <b>90</b> can be sized such that they can retain the axle <b>32</b> while allowing the axle <b>32</b> and the wheels <b>21</b> to rotate. In this example, each of the one or more apertures <b>90</b> can include a rotatable bearing to allow rotation of the axle <b>32</b> relative to the corresponding wheel mount <b>89</b>. In another example, the axle <b>32</b> can be fixedly coupled within the one or more apertures <b>90</b>, and the wheels <b>21</b> can be rotatably coupled to the ends of the axle such that the wheels <b>21</b> rotate while the axle <b>32</b> remains stationary. In this example, each of the wheels <b>21</b> can be coupled to an end of the axle <b>32</b> by a rotatable bearing.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The example of the rotary tiller <b>10</b> has been described as including a drive system <b>13</b> having an electric motor <b>72</b>, a battery <b>15</b>, a battery connector <b>84</b>, and an electronic motor controller <b>86</b> merely for purposes of example and not limitation. In an example, the electric motor <b>72</b> can receive power from a power cord coupled to the rotary tiller <b>10</b> and extending to a power outlet. In various alternative examples, other types of power sources and engines can be used, such as gasoline, diesel, petroleum, or propane powered combustion engines. In these examples, the battery <b>15</b> can be replaced with a suitable fuel tank.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a cross-sectional view of a portion of the rotary tiller <b>10</b> from a front side of the tine hood assembly <b>18</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the electric motor <b>72</b>, the planetary gearbox <b>74</b>, the gearbox output shaft <b>76</b>, and the extension shaft <b>78</b> can all be operatively assembled within an interior portion of the drum <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Consequently, the drive and transmission portions of the rotary tiller <b>10</b> can be isolated from the exterior of the rotary tiller <b>10</b> such that they do not interfere with the tilling operation or impose limitations on the cutting and tilling actions of the tines <b>16</b>. This positioning of the drive and transmission components can result in a greater tilling width, avoidance of an untilled strip in the center of the tilling path, and a reduction in the amount of vegetation that might otherwise be wound around the drive and transmission portions of the rotary tiller.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the electric motor <b>72</b> can be coupled to the first side shield <b>40</b> with one or more fastening members, such as a threaded bolt <b>92</b>, extending between opposing sides of the electric motor <b>72</b> and configured to engage a threaded receptacle <b>94</b> on an interior surface of the first side shield <b>40</b>. Although the cross-section of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> depicts a single bolt <b>92</b>, at least one additional bolt <b>92</b> can be provided. In an example, three such bolts <b>92</b> can be utilized. An output shaft or gear <b>96</b> of the electric motor <b>72</b> can extend in an axial direction into the planetary gearbox <b>74</b>. A gearbox bearing <b>98</b>, extending around a circumference of the planetary gearbox <b>74</b>, can be retained by a bearing retainer plate <b>100</b> extending from an inner surface of the drum <b>34</b>. In an example, the bearing retainer plate <b>100</b> can be welded to the drum <b>34</b>. The gearbox bearing <b>98</b> can be configured to allow for rotation of the drum <b>34</b> around the stationary planetary gearbox <b>74</b> and electric motor <b>72</b> with minimal friction.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">As further illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the second end <b>82</b> of the extension shaft <b>78</b> can be inserted through a shaft bearing <b>102</b> secured to the second side shield <b>42</b>, such as by a press-fit coupling. Once inserted into the shaft bearing <b>102</b>, axial movement of the extension shaft <b>78</b> toward the interior of the hub <b>34</b> can be prevented by coupling a snap ring (not shown) into a snap ring groove <b>103</b> formed in the second end <b>82</b> of the extension shaft <b>78</b>. The shaft bearing <b>102</b> can be configured to allow for rotation of the extension shaft when driven by the electric motor <b>72</b> and planetary gearbox <b>74</b>. Interconnection of the extension shaft <b>78</b> with the drum <b>74</b> can be accomplished with, for example, a key member <b>104</b> positioned within the keyway <b>79</b> defined in the extension shaft <b>78</b> near the second end <b>82</b>. Particularly, the key member <b>104</b> can be located on a plate <b>106</b> extending from the inner surface of the drum <b>34</b>. In an example, the plate <b>106</b> can be welded to the drum <b>34</b>. When the key member <b>104</b> is positioned within the keyway <b>79</b>, rotation of the extension shaft <b>78</b> can be transferred to the drum <b>34</b>, thus causing rotation of the tines <b>16</b> for performing a tilling operation.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a perspective view of the planetary gearbox <b>74</b> removed from the rotary tiller <b>10</b>, in accordance with an example of the present disclosure. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the planetary gearbox <b>74</b> can include a housing <b>108</b> having a series of inwardly-facing teeth <b>110</b> extending between a first end <b>112</b> and a second end <b>114</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a portion of the housing <b>108</b> has been cut away to better illustrate the internal components of the planetary gearbox <b>74</b>. The planetary gearbox <b>74</b> can further include a first set of planetary gears <b>116</b> coupled to a first rotatable disk <b>118</b> and configured to mesh with the output gear <b>96</b> of the electric motor <b>72</b>, and a second set of planetary gears <b>120</b> coupled to a second rotatable disk <b>122</b>. One or more mounting features, such as mounting apertures <b>124</b> configured to receive fastening members, can be located around the periphery of the first end <b>112</b> of the housing <b>108</b> to allow for mounting of the planetary gearbox <b>74</b> within the hub <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is an exploded perspective view of the planetary gearbox <b>74</b> removed from the rotary tiller <b>10</b>, in accordance with an example of the present disclosure. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, each of the gears in the first set of planetary gears <b>116</b> includes a channel <b>126</b> configured to receive and engage a post <b>128</b> extending from the first rotatable disk <b>118</b>. An opposing side of the first rotatable disk <b>118</b> includes an intermediate drive gear <b>129</b> fixed thereto and configured to mesh with the second set of planetary gears <b>120</b>. Each of the gears in the second set of planetary gears <b>120</b> includes a channel <b>130</b> configured to receive and engage a post <b>132</b> extending from the second rotatable disk <b>122</b>. An opposing side of the second rotatable disk <b>122</b> includes the gearbox output shaft <b>76</b> fixed thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In an example, the output gear <b>96</b> can rotate in direction D<b>1</b> and mesh with the first set of planetary gears <b>116</b>, which causes the first set of planetary gears <b>116</b> to rotate in an opposite direction D<b>2</b>. Due to the meshing engagement between the teeth of the first set of planetary gears <b>116</b> and the inwardly-facing teeth <b>110</b> of the stationary housing <b>108</b>, together with the rotatable coupling between the posts <b>128</b> of the first rotatable disk <b>118</b> and the channels <b>126</b>, the first rotatable disk <b>118</b> is driven in direction D<b>1</b>. Because the intermediate drive gear <b>129</b> is fixedly coupled to the first rotatable disk <b>118</b>, the intermediate drive gear <b>129</b> is also driven in direction D<b>1</b>. Subsequently, the meshing engagement between the intermediate drive gear <b>129</b> and the second set of planetary gears <b>120</b> causes the second set of planetary gears <b>120</b> to rotate in direction D<b>2</b>. Furthermore, due to the meshing engagement between the teeth of the second set of planetary gears <b>120</b> and the inwardly-facing teeth <b>110</b> of the stationary housing <b>108</b>, together with the rotatable coupling between the posts <b>132</b> of the second rotatable disk <b>122</b> and the channels <b>130</b>, the second rotatable disk <b>122</b>, along with the gearbox output shaft <b>76</b>, is driven in direction D<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The foregoing description of the planetary gearbox operation can allow for a significant reduction in rotational speed, while also allowing a higher torque to be transmitted to the gearbox output shaft <b>76</b>. In an example, the gear reduction between the output gear <b>96</b> and the intermediate drive gear <b>129</b> can be between about 2:1 and about 40:1. In an example, the gear reduction between the intermediate drive gear <b>129</b> and the gearbox output shaft <b>76</b> can also be between about 2:1 and about 40:1. The requisite gear ratio can be dependent on the speed of the input motor and the desired tine speed during a tilling operation. In an example, the desired tine speed can be about 200 revolutions per minute (RPM).</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref> illustrate only one example of a planetary gearbox <b>74</b> in accordance with the present disclosure. Thus, the planetary gearbox <b>74</b> can include other configurations of gears, numbers of gears, and sizes of gears that produce different gear reduction ratios without departing from the intended scope of the present disclosure. For example, although a two-stage planetary gear system is shown, planetary gear systems having more than two stages, or a single stage, can be utilized. Furthermore, the output gear <b>96</b> is described as being rotated in direction D<b>1</b> merely for purposes of example and not limitation. Thus, in other examples, the output gear <b>96</b> can be rotated in direction D<b>2</b>.</p>

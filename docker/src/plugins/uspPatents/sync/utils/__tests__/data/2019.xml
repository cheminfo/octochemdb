<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application claims priority from Spanish patent application number U 201731040, filed on Sep. 8, 2017, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a machine for picking up rocks from the soil, which provides essential novelty features and considerable advantages with respect to the means known and used for the same purposes in the current state of the art.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The field of application of the invention is comprised in the industrial sector dedicated to the manufacture of agricultural machinery.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Those skilled in the art are well aware of the need to perform operations for picking up rocks from soils for collecting and removing rocks having sizes exceeding a given pre-established limit for the purpose of conditioning the soil for crop and/or livestock farming or development.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A wide range of machines that are in charge of performing this conditioning work are known in the current state of the art, most of which machines share a common operating feature that consists of providing a frame prepared to be towed by a tractor vehicle, which machines have in the front part (according to the working direction) extraction means prepared to be driven into the ground (for example, strong teeth-like metallic elements), sized to reach up to a limited depth, such that with the towing of the machine by the tractor vehicle, said extraction elements are driven over the soil, thereby causing rocks or other objects exceeding previously determined size to reach the surface of the soil.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, these machines do not have means for stockpiling these surfaced rocks and completely cleaning the dirt off of them, and clods often times adhere to said rocks, increasing weight and volume when transporting them off the soil.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The machine of the invention generally comprises the following configuration:
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0008">In the mouth of the machine, there is arranged in a parallel manner and with a certain elevation, a rotating feed reel, said reel comprising a shaft attached to a series of arms, arranged in a radial manner and parallel to one another, at the end of which there may optionally be teeth made of an anti-wear material, arranged with a suitable inclination, such that upon rotation, said teeth push rocks and other materials into the machine and onto a conveyor belt, said reel being fixed to swinging side arms which allow the upward and downward movement of the reel, thereby allowing the passage of rocks. This element, together with the main operation of picking up rocks, is an operative improvement for destroying weeds, breaking up and clearing the soil of clods, and keeping the inlet or mouth of the machine clean, preventing aggregates from being driven, and achieving better performance of the machine;</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0009">Additionally, the conveyor belt on which are the rocks extracted from the soil are deposited can be provided with an ejector device, as a result of which the machine is able to work year-round regardless of the viscosity conditions of the soil. The device includes a group of rotating blades, made up of a plurality of blades inserted along a common shaft and adjacent to one another, separated by a predetermined pitch, the blades being designed such that with the rotation thereof, they break up the clods dumped thereon from the driving belt, sieving the material such that both the crumbled up dirt and smaller-sized rocks fall into the soil, and transferring to the collection receptacle (generally a hopper) only those rocks that exceed a pre-established size;</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0010">It can also incorporate for each side chain of the conveyor belt a guiding sprocket which can be positioned in height in order to keep the respective chains positioned in the upper part, to prevent rocks from getting between the lower inlet guide and the chain, and to thereby prevent possible jams;</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0011">It can also incorporate elastic skirts on the chains on both sides, for the purpose of preventing rocks from getting between the links of the chains;</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0012">It can also incorporate supporting and guiding rollers for moving the chains, which have the dual purpose of preventing on one hand premature wear thereof, and successively providing on the other hand corrugated, upwardly concave sections of the belt conveying the material, with the added advantage that this configuration causes greater friction and movement between the materials on the belt, with the subsequent breaking up of the clods, and thereby sieving aggregates while traveling;</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0006" num="0013">It can incorporate means for unloading the materials (essentially rocks) deposited in a collection hopper onto a trailer or other means of transport, by means of lifting said hopper due to the action of hydraulic or pneumatic cylinders up to the height of said means of transport (for example, a truck, a carriage used for agricultural purposes, or the like), and</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0007" num="0014">It can incorporate double clutch operation (rotation) reversing means between the power take-off of the tractor and a double-output reducer gear, such that under normal conditions the output shaft rotates in a given direction (for example to the right) by direct transmission from the power take-off, and optionally after the activation of a piston acting on the double clutch, it disengages from the direct transmission and connects to a hydraulic motor that rotates the output take-off in the opposite direction (for example to the left); the movement in the opposite direction is utilized for the purpose of unjamming the machine, after which the mechanism can be reconnected to the power take-off of the vehicle by means of actuating the piston in the opposite direction.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0015">A highly productive machine which picks up rocks from the soil, leaving the greatest amount of dirt possible therein and only extracting rocks and stones of a given caliber and larger, and which can work year-round, is thereby obtained.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0021" num="0027">As mentioned above, the detailed description of the preferred embodiment of the object of the invention will be provided below in reference to the attached drawings, in which the same reference numbers are used to designate identical or similar parts. Therefore, first taking <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> of the drawings into account, a schematic depiction of an embodiment can be seen in which the various extraction elements incorporated on the advancing edge of the machine, made in the form of teeth (<b>1</b>), associated with the tooth bar region (<b>10</b><i>a</i>) of the structure (<b>10</b>) of the rock picker, having certain play, with which other teeth (<b>1</b>) of the same type incorporated on a rotating reel (<b>100</b>) collaborate, the teeth (<b>1</b>) and the tooth bar (<b>10</b><i>a</i>) being built using anti-wear steel for the purpose of extending the service life of the machine, and each tooth (<b>1</b>) of those incorporated in the tooth bar region (<b>10</b><i>a</i>) of the structure (<b>10</b>) being arranged at a predetermined angle with respect to the surface of the soil determined as being optimal for operations consisting of eliminating weeds and clearing away clods, the inlet of the machine to the conveyor belt (<b>36</b>) therefore being kept cleaner and at the same time preventing aggregates from being driven. The reel (<b>100</b>) is assembled on swinging side arms (<b>40</b>) which allow the upward and downward movement of the reel (<b>100</b>), thereby allowing the passage of the rocks.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0028">In turn, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2<i>a </i>to 2<i>c </i></figref>illustrate three views of an ejector device (<b>11</b>) designed for being located in the machine in an intermediate position between the trailing edge of the conveyor belt (not visible in the drawings) and a rock receiving hopper (<b>18</b>) (not visible in these drawings), the purpose of which essentially consists of subjecting the materials moved by the conveyor belt (rocks, dirt, aggregates, etc.) to a sieving operation for the purpose of trying to get only those rocks having a size greater than a predetermined limit to get to the hopper (<b>18</b>) free of clods or other substances. The ejector device (<b>11</b>) comprises a strong metal frame (<b>2</b>) housing therein a plurality of blades (<b>3</b>) which are successively attached in an integral manner to a rotating shaft (<b>4</b>), and which blades (<b>3</b>) are opposite a first series of counter-blade portions (<b>5</b>) emerging from a side of the frame (<b>2</b>) in respectively alternating positions with respect to the blades (<b>3</b>) and taking a curvilinear inner profile (<b>5</b><i>a</i>) converging with the path of the end of the blade (<b>3</b>) according to the direction of rotation of the blades, and also opposite a second series of counter-blade portions (<b>6</b>) projecting with an inclination diverging slightly towards the outside from a side of the frame diametrically opposite the aforementioned side, and taking up like the first counter-blade portions (<b>5</b>) alternating positions with respect to the blades (<b>3</b>). The separation (or pitch) between successive blades (<b>3</b>) is equivalent to that of the counter-blades (<b>5</b>, <b>6</b>), allowing the passage of said blades (<b>3</b>) through the separating spaces of the counter-blades (<b>5</b>, <b>6</b>), and thereby assuring the destruction of clods or other unwanted substances, and therefore sieving the materials according to their size. As will be understood, a device like the one described is particularly useful in cases in which the soil is wet, and therefore clumped portions of dirt in the form of clods are raised up.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0029">Now in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, said figure shows a guiding device for a chain, which device has been incorporated by the invention in the rock picker in the front position, i.e., in the area of entrance of the materials uprooted by the teeth (<b>1</b>) of the machine, for the purpose of assuring that the side chains (<b>17</b>) of the conveyor belt (<b>36</b>) are kept at a predetermined height. Essentially, the device comprises a rigid upright (<b>7</b>), provided at one of its ends (specifically, the end taking up the upper position) with means for coupling to the structure (<b>10</b>) of the machine and fixing by means of screws (<b>8</b>) screwed into a tubular sleeve (<b>13</b>) inside which it is able to move, whereas in relation to the opposite end (specifically, the end taking up the lower position) it includes an orthogonal shaft (<b>9</b>) holding a sprocket wheel (<b>12</b>) with which the corresponding chain (<b>17</b>) meshes. With this arrangement, the height position of the rigid upright (<b>7</b>) can be adjusted by loosening the screws (<b>8</b>) for the purpose of keeping the sprocket (<b>12</b>) with which the chain (<b>17</b>) on that side meshes at a raised height for suitable preventing rocks from getting between the chain and the corresponding lower guide (not visible in the drawing) which may jam up and/or damage the drive mechanism. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a guiding device is provided on each side for both side chains (<b>17</b>). The conveyor belt (<b>36</b>) (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) is completed with rods (<b>37</b>) assembled between said side chains (<b>17</b>) leaving gaps (<b>41</b>) for screening the dirt. The rods (<b>37</b>) are telescopic and have an expansion spring (<b>38</b>) for the assembly and disassembly thereof between the links of the side chains (<b>17</b>), as seen in the detail of the disassembled rod on the right side of said <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. Furthermore, the conveyor belt (<b>36</b>) comprises transverse restraints (<b>39</b>) to improve the upward driving of the uprooted material.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0030">In addition to the protections discussed above, the invention has provided for the rock picker to incorporate closing skirts for closing the sides of the conveyor belt (<b>36</b>) preventing rocks from getting into sensitive regions of the machine. Specifically, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows an embodiment in which respective skirts (<b>14</b>) are shown, extending according to the longitudinal direction of the machine in a position such that they project from side supports (<b>15</b>) of the structure (<b>10</b>) of the machine, completely covering each side chain (<b>17</b>) and thereby preventing any rock from penetrating same. This arrangement is extraordinarily useful if it is taken into account that the side chains (<b>17</b>), located on both sides of the conveyor belt (<b>36</b>), move on guiding rollers (<b>16</b>) (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, where the rods of the conveyor belt (<b>36</b>) have been eliminated to better see said rollers (<b>16</b>) and an upper branch of the chains (<b>17</b>)) spaced successively along the longitudinal driving direction, which causes both the side chains (<b>17</b>) (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) and the conveyor belt assembly to take a longitudinally winding configuration that may favor rocks getting into chain driving regions, and even stop said chain, and with the arrangement of such skirts (<b>14</b>) the occurrence of this drawback is prevented. The skirts (<b>14</b>) are made of a strong but suitably elastic material (preferably a material based on suitably treated steel).</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0031">To prevent the premature wear generated in the movable members when the chains move along rails, as mentioned above, the invention has provided the use of a plurality of guiding rollers (<b>16</b>) located along the path of the chains (<b>17</b>) on both sides, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. This depiction clearly shows the longitudinally winding profile of the chains (<b>17</b>) (and therefore, of the conveyor belt (<b>36</b>) in general), causing the materials that are driven upwards towards the collection hopper to be subjected to the peaks and valleys of such winding path. This fact also helps to break up clods and again constitutes a sieving for the dirt and smaller-sized aggregates that are driven along the conveyor path.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0032">On the other hand, as mentioned above, the machine of the invention provides an optional embodiment with a lifting device that allows unloading materials onto means of transport. According to an embodiment of the invention shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6<i>a</i></figref>, the machine (<b>10</b>&#x2032;) includes means articulated on a double chassis, preferably of the hydraulic type, which allow lifting the hopper (<b>18</b>) to a height that is sufficient for being unloaded onto a trailer or another container. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6<i>a </i></figref>shows the machine (<b>10</b>&#x2032;) in the working position, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6<i>b </i></figref>shows the same machine (<b>10</b>&#x2032;) in the raised position, i.e., in the unloading position.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0033">According to the first depiction (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6<i>a</i></figref>), the structure of the machine provides an inclined plane along which the materials are driven by means of the conveyor belt (not visible in the drawing) made up of rods (<b>37</b>) extending between both side chains (<b>17</b>) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>), such that the materials uprooted by the teeth (<b>1</b>) present on the leading edge LE move upwards towards the trailing edge TE from where they fall into the collection and accumulation hopper (<b>18</b>). The machine (<b>10</b>&#x2032;), towed from its front part by a tractor vehicle (not visible in the drawing), moves by means of a pair of side wheels (<b>19</b>) assembled in respective articulated arms (<b>20</b>), and the lifting device comprising operating cylinders (<b>21</b>), which are preferably hydraulic, extending between the articulated arms (<b>20</b>) for supporting the wheels (<b>19</b>) and other articulated arms (<b>22</b>) linking the material collection and accumulation hopper (<b>18</b>) and the structure of the machine (<b>10</b>&#x2032;).</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0034">As discussed, the machine of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6<i>a </i></figref>is in the operative position, collecting materials on the leading edge LE for the operation of picking up rocks, and transferring the rocks from its trailing edge TE to the hopper (<b>18</b>). When the material accumulated in the hopper (<b>18</b>) is to be unloaded onto a trailer or other means of transport, the operation of the cylinders (<b>21</b>) allows the machine to take a position such as the one shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6<i>b</i></figref>, such that the hopper (<b>18</b>) is now at a height that is sufficient for being emptied out in a trailer or means of transport of another type.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0035">It will be understood that the lifting capacity of the machine with respect to the plane of the ground can also be utilized to separate the leading edge LE from the plane of the ground and thereby allow the machine to move from one position to another.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0036">Now referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> of the drawings, said figure schematically depicts a double clutch unit (<b>23</b>) provided specifically for the optional incorporation thereof in the machine, in a position sandwiched between the power take-off of the tractor vehicle and the input of a double-output gear reducer to the outputs of which the conveyor belt (<b>36</b>) and other movable elements (reel (<b>100</b>), ejector device (<b>11</b>)) are connected. Therefore, the force transmitted through the input shaft portion (<b>24</b>) to the output shaft portion (<b>24</b>&#x2032;) is controlled by a double clutch which is activated by means of a cylinder (<b>25</b>) which, through an articulated fork (<b>26</b>) in the actual structure of the unit, can longitudinally move the clutch mechanism and its associated sprocket (<b>27</b>) (main sprocket) through an articulated connecting rod mechanism (<b>30</b>). A hydraulic motor (<b>28</b>) has been provided on the sides, the actuation of which motor (<b>28</b>) rotates a secondary sprocket (<b>29</b>) linked to the shaft of the motor and capable of operatively meshing with the main sprocket (<b>27</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0037">In the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the rotational movement transmitted to the output shaft portion (<b>24</b>&#x2032;) from the input shaft portion (<b>24</b>) is performed in the same direction of rotation of the latter. However, by means of actuating the cylinder (<b>25</b>), the movement of the sprocket (<b>27</b>) and subsequent disengagement of the input shaft (<b>24</b>) are caused, leading the sprocket (<b>27</b>) to mesh with the sprocket (<b>29</b>), and now receiving movement from the motor (<b>28</b>) the rotation of which occurs in the direction opposite the direction communicated through the input shaft (<b>24</b>), and therefore transferring this rotation in the opposite direction to the output shaft (<b>24</b>&#x2032;). Rotation is thereby reversed without having to decouple the machine from the power take-off of the tractor vehicle, and the benefit of being able to unjam the machine if needed is furthermore achieved. Of course when the cylinder (<b>25</b>) is returned to its initial position, the output shaft (<b>24</b>&#x2032;) again rotates in the same direction as the input shaft (<b>24</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0038">According to an embodiment of the rock picker of the invention, it has been provided that the machine can optionally incorporate means for regulating and adjusting the working depth by means of the positional regulation of the hitching means for hitching with the tractor vehicle. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows an example of a mechanism susceptible to being incorporated in the rock picker, which is made up of a hitching bar (<b>31</b>) with a front end (<b>31</b>&#x2032;) suitable for being fixed to the rear hitch of the tractor, and is provided at the opposite end with a transverse bar (<b>32</b>) from which a pair of cylinders (<b>33</b>) emerges, one at each end of the transverse bar (<b>32</b>), positioned such that when hydraulically operated by the driver of the vehicle and the respective rods thereof are extended, the controlled downward movement of the structure (<b>10</b><i>a</i>) of the rock picker can be caused and the driving depth of the teeth (<b>1</b>) thereby controlled.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0039">Additionally, in a manner complementary to the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6<i>a </i>and 6<i>b </i></figref>of the attached drawings, the machine of the invention can incorporate a packing up mechanism which allows reducing the volume thereof enough so that it can be introduced in a container for transport purposes or the like. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows an example of an optional packing up mechanism, made up of one or more packing up turnbuckles located on the sides of the machine, extending between the lifting device and the main chassis of the machine, where each packing up mechanism turnbuckle comprises a central cylindrical body (<b>34</b>) which is linked at its ends in a screw-like manner to respective threaded rods (<b>35</b>) in reverse directions, articulated at the positions for the anchoring thereof with the lifting device and the main chassis of the machine. Therefore, with the rotation of the mentioned central cylindrical body (<b>34</b>) the distance between the ends of the turnbuckle is reduced or increased, depending on the direction of rotation imparted to the central body <b>34</b>, and the machine is thereby taken to different positional heights, including maximum packing up, i.e., minimal height, which is enough to allow it to be introduced in a container, as mentioned.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0040">Finally, and making reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, said figure shows the drive mechanism for driving the rotating elements of the machine (conveyor belt (<b>36</b>) and reel (<b>100</b>)). Said mechanism comprises a hydraulic pump (<b>42</b>) providing the pressure required for the operation of the corresponding hydraulic motors (<b>43</b>) operating these elements. Specifically, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> shows the hydraulic pump (<b>42</b>) coupled to the hydraulic motor (<b>43</b>) operating the side chains (<b>17</b>) of the conveyor belt (<b>36</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0041">It is not considered necessary to extend the content of the present description so that one skilled in the art will be able to understand its scope and the advantages derived from it, as well as to carry out the practical embodiment of the subject-matter thereof.</p>

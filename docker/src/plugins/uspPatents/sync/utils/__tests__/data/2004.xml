<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to the field of protective body armor and more particularly to stab and ballistic resistant body armor pads. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> In the evolution of protective garments, there has been an ever pressing desire to develop stronger, lighter, thinner, cooler, more breathable and thereby more wearable garments. Such garments include ballistic resistant garments which are made to resist potentially lethal forces such as those from gun shots. Typically, these ballistic resistant garments are designed to protect the wearer from ballistic forces by preventing penetration through a protective pad of the garment from a projectile bullet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Puncture or stab resistant protective garments have also been developed which have layers of woven sheets of a puncture resistant pad which is constructed to protect puncture penetration from a sharp object through the pad. Examples of such puncture or stab resistant garments may be found in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,960,470 and 6,154,880 of T. E. Bachner, Jr. and assigned to Second Chance Body Armor, Inc. Multipurpose body armor garments have also been developed by Second Chance Body Armor, Inc. in which a protective pad has both a ballistic resistant panel and a puncture resistant panel for protection against ballistic threats and stab/slash threats from sharp objects or weapons. Examples of such combined puncture resistant and ballistic resistant protective garments can be found in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,131,193 and 6,219,842 of T. E. Bachner, Jr. and assigned to Second Chance Body Armor, Inc. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> Recently, voluntary governmental stab resistant test criteria standards have been established to certify certain stab resistant garments. The tests determine the ability of the stab resistant body armor article to provide protection against injury from penetration from knives, edged weapons, and sharp pointed objects while ensuring that the movement of the wearer is not unduly restricted. In particular, the National Institute of Justice (NIJ) 0115.00 Standard Certification tests are tests for determining the stab resistance of certain personal body armor products. The NIJ Standard&mdash;0115.00 tests are grouped into different Protection Levels (Spike Level 1, Spike Level 2, Spike Level 3). With each Protection Level, the test protocol requires the knife blade or spike to impact the armor test sample at two distinct energy levels; called &ldquo;E1&rdquo; and &ldquo;E2&rdquo;. For the &ldquo;E1&rdquo; energy level, a maximum blade or spike penetration of 7 mm (0.28 in) is allowable. The test protocol then requires an overtest condition where the knife blade or spike kinetic energy is increased by 50%. At this higher energy condition, called &ldquo;E2,&rdquo; a maximum blade or spike penetration of 20 mm (0.79 in) is allowable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Table 1 describes the three protection levels for stab resistant body armor.

<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Various voluntary governmental ballistic standards have also been established to certify certain ballistic resistant garments. The tests determine the ability of the garment to resist penetration and also measure backface signature resulting from various ballistic rounds shot from various types of weapons. In particular, the National Institute of Justice (NIJ) Standard 0101.04 certification tests are ballistics tests for certifying certain body armor products. The NIJ Standard 0101.04 tests are grouped into different Threat Levels, with each Threat Level corresponding to ballistic projectile penetration stopping capabilities of various ballistic rounds fired from designated weapons. The different Threat Levels have defined criteria for defeating certain ballistic rounds and number of rounds fired as well as defined backface signature requirements. For generally concealable type ballistic resistant body armor NIJ Standard certification tests are often performed for NIJ Threat Levels IIA, II and IIIA. NIJ Threat Level IIIA is a higher standard level than NIJ Threat Level II and which in turn is a higher standard level than NIJ Threat Level IIA. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, there is a need to provide thin and lightweight multipurpose body armor which provides both stab and ballistic resistant capabilities which meet stab and ballistic certification tests.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, multipurpose ballistic and stab resistant garment <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is shown having a multipurpose stab and ballistic resistant pad <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The pad <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> has puncture resistant panel <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> with multiple puncture resistant sheets <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of woven aramid fibers. The puncture resistant sheets <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> are formed from a weave of at least sixty (60) aramid warp fibers per inch and at least sixty (60) aramid weft fibers per inch. The multipurpose stab and ballistic resistant pad <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> also has a ballistic resistant panel <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of multiple ballistic resistant sheets <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of woven lyotropic liquid crystal polymer fiber. The ballistic resistant sheets <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> may selectively have a weave with a warp of less than sixty (60) lyotropic liquid crystal polymer fibers per inch and a weft of less than sixty (60) lyotropic liquid crystal polymer fibers per inch. In one example, the high strength lyotropic liquid crystal polymer warp and weft fibers of the individual woven ballistic resistant sheets <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are woven in a plain weave of 25&times;24 lyotropic liquid crystal polymer fibers per inch; however various balanced or imbalanced weaves may be employed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> As seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> pad cover <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> constructed of waterproof and moisture vapor permeable material is used to cover and enclose the puncture resistant sheets <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and the ballistic resistant sheets <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the stab and ballistic resistant pad <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. It will be appreciated that pad cover <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> encloses the entire pad <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. To protect the pad <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> from outer elements, and body oils and salts, pad cover <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> is constructed at least in part of a waterproof oleophobic and moisture vapor permeable material, such as GORE-TEX&reg; manufactured by W. L. Gore &amp; Associates, Inc., for covering and enclosing the puncture resistant sheets <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and ballistic sheets <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the pad <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. Pad cover <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> may alternatively utilize Supplex&reg;, a highly breathable material formed from nylon and treated with dynamic water repellant which is made by E. I. DuPont de Nemours &amp; Company. Other covering materials may selectively be used such as rip stop nylon. The set of puncture resistant sheets <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> in panel <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and the set of ballistic resistant sheets <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> in panel <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are non-invasively held to each other. In one example, tape <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> is used to hold the puncture resistant sheets <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and ballistic resistant sheets <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to each other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> In the example seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the puncture resistant sheets <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> are positioned at a strike side of the garment <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> relative to the ballistic resistant sheets <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. The puncture resistant sheets <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> may selectively have woven aramid fibers having: filaments which provide from 50,000,000 to 90,000,00 filament crossovers per square inch; a break elongation of greater than 3.0 percent; and a tenacity of greater than 23.8 grams per denier. In one example, the aramid fibers woven in the sheets <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> of puncture resistant panel <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are at least 200 denier, have a break elongation of at least 3.45 percent, and a tenacity of at least 27.0 grams per denier. The aramid fibers may selectively be constructed of Kevlar&reg; 159, manufactured by E. I. DuPont de Nemours &amp; Company of Wilmington, Del., and may be selectively woven into a 70 fiber per inch&times;70 fiber per inch weave in the puncture resistant sheets. For further details on the fibers of the puncture resistant sheets, reference can be made to U.S. Pat. No. 5,960,470 of Bachner, which is assigned to the assignee of the present invention and which is incorporated herein by reference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The lyotropic liquid crystal polymer fiber woven in the weave of the ballistic resistant sheets <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> may selectively be formed from poly(p-phenylene-2,6-benzobisoxazole). The lyotropic liquid crystal polymer fiber generally may have one or more of the following characteristics: a) a filament denier of 1.5 dpf; b) a density ranging from 1.54 to 1.56 g/cm<highlight><superscript>3</superscript></highlight>; c) a tensile strength of 42 grams/denier; d) a tensile modulous ranging from 1300 to 2000 grams/denier; e) a decomposition temperature in air of 650 degrees centigrade; and f) a break elongation ranging from 2.5 percent to 3.5 percent. The high strength lyotropic liquid crystal fibers woven in the ballistic resistant sheets <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> in one example, are poly(p-phenylene-2,6-benzobisoxazole) (PBO) fibers such as those sold under the trademark name Zylon&reg; by Toyobo Co., Ltd. of Osaka, Japan. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2, a</cross-reference> cross sectional view of one example of a multipurpose stab and ballistic resistant pad <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> is shown (with stitching removed) having a panel <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> of puncture resistant sheets <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> placed atop a panel <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of ballistic resistant sheets <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>. In this example, the pad <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> has eight (8) puncture resistant sheets <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and sixteen ballistic resistant sheets <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> such that the pad <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> meets a level of stab resistance under National Institute of Justice Standard 0115.00 for Spike Level 1 and a level of ballistic resistance under National Institute of Justice Standard 0101.04 for Threat Level IIA. In this example, the pad <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> has an areal density of approximately 0.56 to 0.57 lbs/ft<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>. The combined areal density in this example of the eight puncture resistant sheets <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is approximately 0.21 lbs/ft<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>and the combined areal density of the sixteen ballistic resistant sheets <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is approximately 0.36 lbs/ft<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>. The pad 22 generally has a thickness of approximately 0.15 inches with the combined thickness of the puncture resistant sheets <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> approximately 0.05 inches and the combined thickness of the ballistic resistant sheets <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> approximately 0.10 inches.

<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, ballistic resistant panel <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of ballistic resistant sheets <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> is shown with stitching through the ballistic resistant sheets to secure the sheets together. The ballistic resistant sheets <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are stitched together with rows of stitches <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of aramid thread generally aligned in one direction (such as at a 45 degree angle) and rows of stitches <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> of aramid thread generally aligned in another crossing direction (such as at a &minus;45 degree angle) to form a quilt stitch pattern <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> through the ballistic resistant sheets <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to secure them together. The rows of stitches <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> may selectively be formed from thread of other high strength materials such as PBO. The rows of stitches <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> in one direction (as well as rows of stitches <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> in the other direction) are selectively spaced 1.0 to 4.25 inches apart from each other. The individual rows of stitches <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> in both directions may selectively employ approximately four stitches per inch to secure together the sheets <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> of the ballistic panel <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Thus, it will be understood that the quilt stitch pattern <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> is not drawn to scale but is illustrative of an exemplary quilt stitch pattern for a ballistic resistant panel. Alternatively, a box stitch pattern formed from crossing rows of stitches of high strength thread with one set of rows aligned in a substantially vertical direction (at 90 degrees) and another set of rows aligned in a substantially horizontal direction (at 0 degrees) may selectively be used to secure together the ballistic sheets of the panel as well as other known stitch pattern in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The ballistic resistant sheets <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> are also stitched together with at least six vertical rows <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of lyotropic liquid crystal polymer fiber thread and at least three horizontal rows <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of lyotropic liquid crystal polymer fiber thread which cross the vertical rows <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> to form a box stitch pattern <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> on at least a portion of the ballistic resistant sheets <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>.

This &ldquo;trauma trap&rdquo; overstitch pattern provides additional protection to the wearer. The vertical rows of thread <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> and horizontal rows of thread in one example are made from PBO material. Alternatively, other high strength materials such as aramid fibers may be employed for the horizontal and vertical rows <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> of thread. Pieces of tape <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> positioned at various locations about the edges of the ballistic resistant sheets <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> may also be selectively employed to hold the sheets <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> in place. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> A method of making a multipurpose ballistic and stab resistant garment is provided. The method comprises the steps of (a) providing puncture resistant sheets of woven aramid fibers to overly one another in which the puncture resistant sheets are formed from a weave of at least 60 aramid warp fibers per inch and at least 60 aramid web fibers per inch, and (b) placing a ballistic resistant sheets of woven lyotropic liquid crystal polymer fiber on at least one side of the puncture resistant sheets. The step of providing the ballistic resistant sheets to have a warp of less than 60 lyotropic liquid crystal polymer fibers per inch and a weft of less than 60 lyotropic liquid crystal polymer fibers per inch is performed. In one example, the lyotropic liquid crystal polymer fibers are selectively provided to have one or more of: (a) a filament denier of 1.5 dpf; (b) a density ranging from 1.54 to 1.56 grams per cubic centimeter; (c) a tensile strength of 42 grams per denier; (d) a tensile modulus ranging from 1300 to 2000 grams per denier; (e) a decomposition temperature in air of 650 degree centigrade; and (f) a break elongation ranging from 2.5% to 3.5%. The lyotropic liquid crystal polymer fiber may selectively be formed from poly (p-phenylene-2,6-benzobisoxazole). The method includes the step of providing the aramid fibers of the puncture resistant sheets to have at least one of: (a) filaments which provide from 50 million to 90 million filament crossovers per square inch; (b) a break elongation of greater than 3.0%; and (c) a tenacity of greater than 23.8 grams per denier. The step of positioning the puncture resistant sheets at a strike side of the garment relative to the ballistic resistant sheets is also performed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment of the method, the respective warps and wefts for the ballistic resistant sheets in the ballistic resistant panel are angularly displaced relative to one another. The angular displacement of weave arrangements between successive sheets may randomly vary or may follow a consistent pattern throughout the ballistic resistant panel. The angular displacement of successive sheets or groups of sheets may range from 22.5 to 45 degrees out of alignment. The step of angularly displacing the warp and weft of one ballistic resistant sheet relative to the warp and the weft of a second ballistic resistant sheet overlying the one ballistic resistant sheet is performed. The warp and weft of one ballistic resistant sheet is angularly displaced relative to the warp and weft of another successive ballistic resistant sheet whereby the angular displacement selectively ranges from 22.5 degree to 45 degree of angular displacement out of alignment. A third ballistic resistant sheet is provided to overly the second ballistic resistant sheet and the warp and the weft of the third ballistic resistant sheet is angularly displaced relative to the warp and the weft of the second ballistic resistant sheet. The step of substantially aligning the warp and the weft of a third ballistic resistant sheet with the warp and the weft of a first ballistic resistant sheet is performed. This pattern may be continued for the sheets throughout the ballistic panel. The ballistic resistant sheets of the ballistic resistant panel are positioned to be adjacent to one another such that the warps and the wefts of successive sheets adjacent to one another are angularly displaced relative to one another throughout the ballistic resistant panel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> An alternative method may selectively be performed whereby groups of two or more ballistic resistant sheets are utilized in which the respective warps and wefts of adjacent groups are angularly displaced relative to one another. The method comprises the step of providing the ballistic resistant sheets with a first group of at least two successive overlying woven ballistic resistant sheets, in which the warp and the weft for individual ones of the successive overlying woven ballistic resistant sheets of the first group are substantially in alignment to one another. A second group of at least another two successive overlying woven ballistic resistant sheets is provided in which the warp and the weft for individual ones of the woven ballistic resistant sheets of the second group are substantially in alignment to one another and are angularly displaced from the warp and the weft of the woven ballistic resistant sheets of the first group. In one example the first group and the second group are provided to have an equal number of successive overlying ballistic resistant sheets, such as two sheets per group. The step of providing an angular displacement between the sheets of one group relative to the ballistic resistant sheets of a next successive group to range from 22.5 to 45 degree out of alignment is performed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> The method may selectively comprise the step of providing a third group of ballistic resistant sheets positioned adjacent to the second group, in which the third group has at least two successive overlying woven ballistic resistant sheets, and in which the warp and the weft for individual ones of the woven ballistic resistant sheets of the third group are substantially in alignment to one another and are angularly displaced relative to the warp and the weft of the ballistic resistant sheets of the second group. The warp and the weft for the sheets of the third group are provided to be substantially in alignment with the warp and the weft of the overlying sheets of the first group. In one example, each of the groups of ballistic resistant sheets in the ballistic resistant panel have an equal number of successive overlying woven ballistic resistant sheets. The step of stitching the ballistic resistant sheets of the ballistic resistant panel together with rows of stitches of aramid thread generally aligned in one direction and with rows of stitches of aramid thread generally aligned in another crossing direction to form a quilt stitch pattern may selectively be performed. This pattern of angularly displacing the weaves of successive groups of sheets may selectively continue throughout the ballistic resistant panel. Additionally, the step of stitching the ballistic resistant sheets of the ballistic resistant panel together with at least six vertical rows of lyotropic liquid crystal polymer thread and with at least three horizontal rows of lyotropic liquid crystal polymer fiber thread such that the horizontal rows and the vertical rows form a box stitch pattern on a portion of the ballistic resistant sheets may be performed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> The multipurpose ballistic and stab resistant pad is also provided with a puncture resistant panel. The step of securing the puncture resistant sheets of the puncture resistant panel together with bar tac stitches positioned proximate a periphery of the woven puncture resistant sheets is performed. The puncture resistant sheets of the puncture resistant panel are non-invasively held to the ballistic resistant sheets of the ballistic resistant panel. The puncture resistant sheets may selectively be held to the ballistic resistant sheets with tape. The step of covering the puncture resistant sheets and the ballistic resistant sheets with a pad cover formed of water proof and moisture vapor permeable material is also performed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> The method may also selectively have the step of angularly displacing respective warps and wefts of individual puncture resistant sheets in the puncture resistant panel. The step of angularly displacing the aramid warp fibers and aramid weft fibers of one puncture resistant sheet relative to the aramid warp fibers and aramid weft fibers of a second puncture resistant sheet which overlies the one puncture resistant sheet is performed. In one example the method comprises the step of angularly displacing the fibers of one puncture resistant sheet relative to the fibers of another successive puncture resistant sheet to range from 22.5 to 45 degree out of alignment. The steps of angularly displacing the aramid warp fibers and aramid weft fibers of a third puncture resistant sheet relative to the aramid warp fibers and aramid weft fibers of the second puncture resistant sheet and substantially aligning the aramid warp fibers and aramid weft fibers of the third puncture resistant sheet with the aramid warp fibers and aramid weft fibers of the first puncture resistant sheet may selectively be performed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> An alternative method of angularly displacing the weaves of groups of individual puncture resistant sheets in the puncture resistant panel may also be performed. In this example, the step of providing the puncture resistant sheets with a first group of at least two successive overlying puncture resistant sheets, in which the aramid warp fibers and aramid weft fibers for individual ones of the successive overlying puncture resistant sheets of the first group are substantially in alignment to one another may be accomplished. A second group is provided having at least two other successive overlying puncture resistant sheets. The aramid warp fibers and aramid weft fibers for individual puncture resistant sheets of the second group are substantially in alignment to one another and are angularly displaced from the aramid warp fibers and aramid weft fibers of the puncture resistant sheets of the first group. In one example, each of the groups of puncture resistant sheets in the puncture resistant panel have an equal number of successive overlying puncture resistant sheets. The step of establishing the angular displacement between the aramid warp fibers and the aramid weft fibers of the puncture resistant sheets of one group relative to the aramid warp fibers and aramid weft fibers of the puncture resistant sheets of another group of puncture resistant sheets to range from 22.5 to 45 degrees out of alignment is performed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> The method comprises the step of positioning a third group of puncture resistant sheets to be adjacent to the second group of puncture resistant sheets, in which the third group has at least two successive overlying puncture resistant sheets. The step of positioning the aramid warp fibers and aramid weft fibers for individual puncture resistant sheets of the third group to be substantially in alignment to one another is accomplished. The aramid warp fibers and aramid weft fibers of the puncture resistant sheets of the third group are angularly displaced relative to the aramid warp fibers and aramid weft fibers of the puncture resistant sheets of the second group. The step of substantially aligning the aramid warp fibers and aramid weft fibers of the overlying puncture resistant sheets of the third group with the aramid warp fibers and aramid weft fibers of the overlying puncture resistant sheets of the first group is accomplished. Each of the groups of puncture resistant sheets in the puncture resistant panel may selectively be provided with an equal number of successive overlying puncture resistant sheets, for instance two sheets per group. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0057" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0057&rsqb;</number> The method of making a multipurpose ballistic and stab resistant garment may selectively include the step of forming a multipurpose stab and ballistic resistant pad which meets a level of stab resistance under National Institute of Justice Standard 0115.004 for various Spike Levels and a level of ballistic resistance under National Institute of Justice Standard 0101.04 for various Threat Levels. In one example the step of forming a multipurpose ballistic and stab resistant pad which comprises puncture resistant sheets and ballistic resistant sheets such that the pad meets a level of stab resistance under National Institute of Justice Standard 0115.00 for Spike Level 1 and a level of ballistic resistance under National Institute of Justice Standard 0101.04 for Threat Level IIA is performed. In this example, the pad may be selectively formed with no more than eight puncture resistant sheets and no more than 16 ballistic resistant sheets. The step of providing the pad with an areal density not greater than 0.56 to 0.57 lbs/ft<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>is performed. The pad in this example may be selectively provided with a combined areal density for the puncture resistant sheets to be no greater than 0.21 lbs/ft<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>and a combined areal density for the ballistic resistant sheets to be no greater than 0.36 lbs/ft<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>. In this example, the step of providing the pad with a thickness not greater than 0.15 inches is performed whereby the pad has a combined thickness for the puncture resistant sheets to be no greater than 0.05 inches and the combined thickness of the ballistic resistant sheets is not greater than 0.10 inches. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0058" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0058&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, a multipurpose stab and ballistic resistant pad may be formed in which the pad meets a level of stab resistance under National Institute of Justice Standard 0115.00 for Spike Level 2 and a level of ballistic resistance under National Institute of Justice Standard 0101.04 for Threat Level II. In this example, the step of forming the pad with no more than 12 puncture resistant sheets and no more than 22 ballistic resistant sheets may selectively be performed. The step of providing the pad with an areal density not greater than 0.80 lbs/ft<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>is performed whereby the pad has a combined areal density for the puncture resistant sheets to be no greater than 0.31 lbs/ft<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>and a combined areal density for the ballistic resistant sheets to be no greater than 0.49 lbs/ft<highlight><superscript>2</superscript></highlight>. The step of providing the pad in this example with a thickness not greater than 0.21 inches may selectively be performed whereby the thickness for the plurality of puncture resistant sheets is not greater than 0.07 inches and a combined thickness of the ballistic resistant sheets is not greater than 0.14 inches. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0059" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0059&rsqb;</number> The step of forming a multipurpose stab and ballistic resistant pad that meets a level of stab resistance under National Institute of Justice Standard 0115.00 for Spike Level 3 and a level of ballistic resistance under National Institute of Justice Standard 0101.04 for Threat Level IIIA is also performed. In this example, the step of forming the pad with no more than 14 puncture resistant sheets and no more than 28 ballistic resistant sheets may selectively be performed. In this example, the pad is provided with an areal density not greater than 0.98 lbs/ft<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>and the step of providing the pad with a combined areal density for the puncture resistant sheets to be no greater than 0.36 lbs/ft<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>and the combined areal density for the ballistic resistant sheets to be not greater than 0.62 lbs/ft<highlight><superscript>2 </superscript></highlight>may selectively be accomplished. The method may include the step of providing the pad with a thickness not greater than 0.26 inches. The pad may be provided with a combined thickness for the puncture resistant sheets to be no greater than 0.08 inches and a combined thickness for the ballistic resistant sheets to be no greater than 0.18 inches in this example. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> This invention relates in general to disposable medical products, and in particular to disposable eye shields designed to prevent liquid from contacting the eyes of a wearer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The wearing of a protective face mask has become standard procedure in many health care and other related activities. The use of a face mask is important, for example, to lab technicians during the conduction of tests, to nurses in the care of contagious patients, to physicians during surgery and to dentists working in a patient&apos;s mouth. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> With the rapid increase in the spread of infectious diseases such as AIDS, the use of protective equipment, including masks, has become even more important. The Center for Disease Control in Atlanta, Ga., has found that AIDS can be passed by contact with body fluids. Contact of AIDS contaminated body fluids with another person&apos;s source of body fluids, i.e. eyes, nose, mouth, etc., can pass the disease. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> It is therefore necessary to prevent a patient&apos;s body fluids from contacting the eyes, nose and mouth of an attendant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> The typical previously developed protective mask covers the wearer&apos;s face from the bridge of the nose to below the chin, and is generally designed to filter out germs and other particulates. Unfortunately, a mask designed to prevent the passage of germs to the respiratory system has little value in preventing liquids from reaching the eyes, and thus normal face masks provide the wearer with no protection against the patient&apos;s body fluids. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> As such, one aspect of the present invention discloses an adjustable eye shield having a flexible, transparent material which is adapted to fit over the eyes and at least partially wrap around the face of a user. The material is divided into different regions. The regions include at least a left region, a right region, and a central region. At least one slit is provided in both the left and the right regions. The slit extends fully across the region thus subdividing the left region into a first and a second section and subdividing the right region into a first and a second section. At least one hole in each of the first sections of the left and the right regions is provided. An adjustable fastener for fastening the eye shield to the head of the user is provided. The adjustable fastener has a plurality of ends. At least one end of the fastener passes through at least one of the holes in the first section of the right region, traverses the slit in the right region, and is fastened to the second section of the right region. At least one other end of the fastener passes through at least one of the holes in the first section of the left region, traverses the slit in the left region, and is secured to the second section of the left region. This enables the first and second sections of each of the left and right regions to slide one over the other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In another aspect of the present invention an adjustable eye shield is disclosed having a flattened, flexible, transparent sheet material divided into a plurality of regions. The regions include at least a left region, a right region, and a central region. At least one slit is provided extending fully across the left region and subdividing the region into a first and a second section. One of the sections has a hole therethrough. At least another slit is provided which extends fully across the right region subdividing the region into a first and a second section. One of these sections also has a hole therethrough. An adjustable fastener having a plurality of ends is provided, where a separate end selected from this plurality of ends is dedicated to each of the left and right regions so that the dedicated end is affixed to one of the sections within its dedicated region, traverses the slit in the same region, and passes through the hole in the remaining section opposite the slit in the same region. Manipulation of the adjustable fastener causes the first and second sections of each of the left and right regions to slide one over the other causing the material to gradually bend without creasing.</paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The present invention and its advantages are best understood by referring to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> of the drawings, like numerals being used for like and corresponding parts of the various drawings. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Referring first to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, an eye shield <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> constructed in accordance with the present invention is shown. The eye shield <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may comprise a clear flexible, plastic film made from, for instance, polyester or polyethylene. Examples of plastic films suitable for the present invention include oriented polyester films such as Mylar&reg; and Melinex&reg; currently manufactured by Dupont. The film must be stiff enough to prevent collapse yet flexible enough to bend. In one embodiment, the film may have a thickness of approximately 0.1 mm. Other embodiments may range from a thickness of approximately 0.076 mm to approximately 0.18 mm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the eye shield <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may comprise at least a top edge <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, a bottom edge <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and a left and a right side edge, <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, respectively. Each of the side edges <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> contain at least one slit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> which extends a distance from its respective side edge toward the opposite side edge. This configuration serves to divide the eye shield <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> into at least three regions; a left region <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and a right region <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> each containing a slit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and a central region <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> disposed between the left and right regions. The central region <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, in certain embodiments, is sufficiently wide so as to completely cover and extend a distance beyond the eyes of a user. The left and right regions <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> respectively are further subdivided lo into first and second sections along the slit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. That is, the left region <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> comprises a first left section <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and a second left section <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> separated by slit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Similarly the right region <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> comprises a first right section <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and a second right section <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> also separated by slit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> As depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the first sections <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> may be uppermost, i.e., located proximate to the top edge <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, with respect to second sections <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> which are located proximate to the bottom edge <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. It should, however, be understood that this configuration is not necessary to the practice of the invention. In fact, the first sections may, in some instances, be more suitably disposed upon the bottom and the second sections would thus be disposed nearer the top. Other possibilities of course exist including subdividing each region <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> into more than two sections. As such, three or more left sections and three or more right sections may be possible and are thus also contemplated as being described and claimed in the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Still looking to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, it can be seen that the first section <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> each contain a hole <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> through which an adjustable fastener <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is passed. The adjustable fastener <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> serves to fasten the eye shield <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to the head of the user. The fastener <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> may comprise a loop of material such as that shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> which may or may not be elastic in nature. By the term &ldquo;elastic&rdquo;, it is meant that the material is stretchable and includes that property of a material by virtue of which it tends to substantially recover to its original size and shape after removal of a force causing deformation of the material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> As stated, it can be seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, that the adjustable fastener <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> comprises a loop of material having a plurality of ends <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, in this case two ends <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. The ends <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> are each affixed to the eye shield <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> at the second sections <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>, respectively. A number of possible fastening methods may be used. For example, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the ends <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> may be passed through holes similar to holes <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> in sections <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and knotted so they do not slip back through the holes. Alternatively, the ends <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> may be fastened to the eye shield by adhesive, heat bond, mechanical fastener, or any other alternative fastening techniques. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> also illustrates that one end <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of the adjustable fastener <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> may be secured to the second section <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of the left region <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The fastener <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> then crosses the slit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and is threaded through the hole <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> in the first section <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> of the left region <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>. The same occurs at the right region <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>. The fastener <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> may be positioned on either the front or back of the eye shield <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, the fastener <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> can be passed through the slit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> from one side of the eye shield <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to the opposite side as will be described with respect to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. Turning now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, the adjustable fastener <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> may comprise a plurality of tie strips such as the two tie strips <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>depicted. These tie strips may or may not be elastic in nature. It should be understood that the specific number of individual tie strips provided is not limited to the two depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. Furthermore, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> depicts the ends <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of the tie strips <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>bonded to the eye shield <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> at bond points <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> It should be pointed out that in this embodiment the strips pass from one side of the shield <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to the opposite through the slits <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. It is also important to note that the <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> embodiment shows the adjustable fastener <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, in this case tie strips <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>as being fastened at ends <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> to the first sections <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> respectively. This configuration serves to illustrate that it is unimportant to the scope of the claims to which sections <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, or <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> that the ends <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of the adjustable fastener <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> are affixed. It also serves to depict the alternative pathway configurations which the fastener <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> may assume, i.e., to remain completely on one side of the eye shield <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> or to pass through the slit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> from one side to the other. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference> also serve to depict differing embodiments regarding the slit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, each slit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> may comprise a widened portion <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>, in this case a circular cutout. This widened portion <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> serves to relieve stresses that may otherwise concentrate at the slit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> which could lead to premature tearing or deformation of the eye shield <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. However, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, these widened portions <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> are not necessary to the practice of the invention. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference> also illustrate possible alternative embodiments of the bottom edge <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> depicts a slit <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> adapted to accommodate the user&apos;s nose. The slit <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is configured similar to slits <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> and in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> terminates in the optional widened portion <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> depicts a generally concave cutout <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> also designed to accommodate the user&apos;s nose. Other embodiments are of course possible and are readily understood by those skilled in the art. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Operation of the device can best be described by turning to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. The eye shield <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> itself is adjusted by manipulation of the adjustable fastener <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>. First, the eye shield <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is positioned across a user&apos;s face so that the central region <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> covers the eyes and the left and right regions <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, respectively and partially wraps around to the side of the user&apos;s head as shown in the FIG. Next the user pulls on the adjustable fastener <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> or fasteners <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b, </italic></highlight>causing the first and second sections <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of the left region <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> to slide one over the other. This enables an edge <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of one section to overlap an edge <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> of the other section allowing an overlapping configuration of the shield <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> at the slit <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Likewise, the first and second sections <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of the right region <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> are caused to slide one over the other in a similar fashion. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> As the adjustable fastener <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is pulled, the end <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> fastened to the eye shield <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> moves closer to the hole <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> through which the adjustable fastener <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> is threaded. In this manner, the adjustable fastener may be adjusted to suit the user&apos;s preference. The user of the eye shield <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may form the shield as required to conform to his or her face by pulling on the adjustable fastener <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> until the eye shield <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> fits the contours of the user&apos;s face. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In use, the eye shield <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> will tend to bend around the user&apos;s face without creasing across the central region <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, which otherwise could impact the user&apos;s clear vision. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> An advantage of the present invention is that this bending is allowed to occur in more than one plane. This is due in part to the combination of the slits <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, and the slit <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> or cutout <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> to accommodate the user&apos;s nose. These slits and/or cutout enable the sections <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>, and <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> of regions <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> to independently slide one over another. The result is a eye shield that serves to deflect thrown or splashed liquids which otherwise could impact the user&apos;s eyes. The eye shield <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> also has the advantage of being lightweight and comfortable thus allowing the user to wear the shield comfortably for long periods of time. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> It is to be understood that eye shields <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> of the type described may also be <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> adapted to be affixed to or used in conjunction with face masks as depicted in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>. Additional features (not shown) that could be incorporated into eye shields of the present invention include: spacers or padding added to the shield to absorb and wick perspiration; a darkened band along the top edge, the bottom edge, side edges, as well as any combination to reduce or minimize glare; additional slits for more controlled deformation of the shield; as well as additional fasteners to secure the shield in place. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Although the present invention and its advantages have been described in detail, it should be understood that various changes, substitutions, and alterations can be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims. </paragraph>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">1. Field of the Invention</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to agricultural implements, and, more particularly, to agricultural field tillage implements.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">2. Description of the Related Art</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Farmers utilize a wide variety of tillage implements to prepare soil for planting. Some such implements include two or more sections coupled together to perform multiple functions as they are pulled through the fields by a tractor. For example, a cultivator/harrow combination, which is capable of simultaneously tilling and leveling of the soil in preparation for planting, may be pulled by the tractor.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In one type of tilling operation, rows or gangs of circular disk blades are pulled through the soil at variable depths to break up clods of soil, as well as size and mix crop residue to provide a more amenable soil structure and condition for planting and to level the soil surface. The gangs of disks are arranged on frames that extend generally laterally with respect to the direction of movement through a field and more particularly are angled with respect to the direction of movement.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The tillage elements used in a tillage implement have a soil engaging depth that is controlled by way of a hydraulic control available to the operator. For combination tillage tools, the depth of the individual elements may be independently set by the operator moving the hydraulic control to lower or raise any or all of the tillage elements. For example, the depth of the ripper shanks is often adjusted by lowering or raising support wheels of the implement. At the same time the disk gang operating depth may be raised, lowered, or left alone. When the implement draft increases, for example on a slope or a wet area, the operator can reduce the soil depth of any of the tillage elements to allow the tractor to pull the implement through the field abnormality.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">When residue mass on the field is reduced it is generally a good practice to reduce the tilling depth of the implement so that the soil closest to the surface has a consistent mixture of crop residue with the rest of the field and target soil coverage may be achieved for adequate soil conservation where slopes vary.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">What is needed in the art is a tilling implement that adjusts residue incorporation in response to pre-determined crop residue mass and field topography.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention provides a tillage implement with a reactive depth control system to control the soil depth of tillage elements.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In one form, the invention is an agricultural tillage system including a carriage frame assembly, a plurality of tillage elements coupled to the carriage frame assembly, an actuator and a residue reactive system. The actuator is moveably coupled to the tillage elements, and is directly in control of a soil contact depth of the tillage elements. The residue reactive system is in controlling communication with the at least one actuator. The residue reactive system reduces the soil contact depth of the tillage elements when the residue mass on the soil is reduced and/or the slope of the soil is above a predetermined value. Conversely, when the crop residue mas increases or the soil slope decreases, the tillage elements may be adjusted to be more aggressive.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In another form, the invention is a depth control system for an agricultural tillage system having a carriage frame assembly, a plurality of tillage elements coupled to the carriage frame assembly. The depth control system has an actuator and a residue reactive system. The actuator is moveably coupled to the tillage elements, and is directly in control of a soil contact depth of the tillage elements. The residue reactive system is in controlling communication with the at least one actuator. The residue reactive system reduces the soil contact depth of the tillage elements when the residue mass on the soil is reduced/increased and/or the slope of the soil is above/below a predetermined value.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Referring now to the drawings, and more particularly to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, there is shown a tillage apparatus <b>10</b> which generally includes a tractor <b>12</b> and an agricultural tillage implement <b>14</b> for tilling and finishing soil prior to seeding.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Agricultural tillage implement <b>14</b> is configured as a multi-section field disk ripper <b>14</b>, and includes a carriage frame assembly <b>16</b>. Carriage frame assembly <b>16</b> is the section that is directly towed by a traction unit, such as agricultural tractor <b>12</b>. Carriage frame assembly <b>16</b> includes a pull hitch <b>18</b> generally extending in a travel direction <b>20</b>, and forward and aft directed carrier frame members <b>22</b>, which are coupled with and extend from pull hitch <b>18</b>. Reinforcing gusset plates <b>24</b> may be used to strengthen the connection between pull hitch <b>18</b> and carrier frame members <b>22</b>. Carriage frame assembly <b>16</b> generally functions to carry a shank frame <b>26</b> for tilling the soil, and a rear implement <b>28</b> for finishing the soil. Shank frame <b>26</b> includes a plurality of arcuate or parabolicly shaped shanks with tilling points at their lower end for tilling the soil. Rear implement <b>28</b> includes a secondary frame <b>30</b>, leveling blades <b>32</b> and rolling (aka, crumbler) basket assemblies <b>34</b>, which coact with each other to finish the soil in preparation for planting. Leveling blades <b>32</b> and rolling basket assemblies <b>34</b> are both attached to secondary frame <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Wheels <b>36</b>, only one of which is shown, are actuated from tractor <b>12</b> to raise or lower the carrier frame members <b>22</b> to place the tillage implement <b>14</b> in a transport position with the wheels <b>36</b> supporting the implement above the ground and an operating position in which the tillage implement <b>14</b> is used to till the soil.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Carrier frame members <b>22</b> also carry a disk frame assembly <b>38</b> which provides support for gangs of disk blades <b>39</b> positioned forward from shank frames <b>26</b>. The disk frame assembly <b>38</b> includes forward and aft frame members <b>40</b> and <b>42</b>, respectively, to which the gangs of disk blades <b>39</b> are connected.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-5</figref>, shank frame <b>26</b> is coupled with carrier or longitudinal frame members <b>22</b> using a pair of horizontal attachment arrangements <b>50</b> at the front of shank frame <b>26</b>, and a pair of rear attachment arrangements <b>52</b> at the rear of shank frame <b>26</b>. More particularly, shank frame <b>26</b> includes a front cross member <b>54</b> and a rear cross member <b>56</b> which are each disposed under the pair of longitudinal frame members <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">A rear set of shanks <b>60</b> are coupled to attachment arrangement <b>52</b>, with shanks <b>62</b> located at a mid-position and shank <b>64</b> is located in a fore position relative to travel direction <b>20</b>. Fore shank <b>64</b> is referred to as a scout shank <b>64</b> in that scout shank <b>64</b> leads all of the shanks <b>60</b> and <b>62</b> as it encounters soil first in the direction of travel <b>20</b>. Shanks <b>60</b>, <b>62</b> and <b>64</b>, disc blades <b>39</b> and leveling elements <b>32</b> and <b>34</b> are all tillage elements and tillage elements can include other soil encountering elements not illustrated herein, but known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">During field operation, shanks <b>60</b>, <b>62</b> and <b>64</b> extending downwardly from shank frame <b>26</b> dig into the soil and may be configured as sub-soiling shanks to break up the hard pan at a particular depth below the surface of the soil. Actuators <b>68</b> are used to control the depth that tillage elements <b>32</b>, <b>34</b>, <b>39</b>, <b>60</b>, <b>62</b> and <b>64</b> penetrate the soil. Additionally, or instead of actuators <b>68</b>, a spring pack <b>70</b> can control the soil contact depth. For purposes herein spring pack <b>70</b> can also be considered an actuator <b>68</b> or <b>70</b> used to control the soil contact depth of the tillage elements <b>32</b>, <b>34</b>, <b>39</b>, <b>60</b>, <b>62</b> and <b>64</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Now, additionally referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref> there is illustrated a depth control system <b>76</b> including a residue reactive system <b>78</b> coupled to actuators <b>68</b> and <b>70</b>. Residue reactive system <b>78</b> includes a controller <b>80</b>, a moisture sensor <b>82</b>, a Global Positioning System (GPS) <b>84</b>, a topology determiner <b>86</b> and a residue determiner <b>88</b>. Moisture sensor <b>82</b> is located proximate to scout shank <b>64</b> and determines the moisture in the soil that scout shank <b>64</b> is bringing to the surface. The moisture sensor <b>82</b> produces a signal representative of the moisture in the soil and this signal is sent to controller <b>80</b> to alter the depth of the tillage elements. Since scout shank <b>64</b> leads the other shanks it is advantageous that the moisture be determined by the lead shank so that the other following shanks can have their depth adjusted in anticipation of the soil conditions just ahead of them in the direction of travel <b>20</b>. So if the moisture content is above a predetermined level then the tillage depth can be lessened for the rest of tillage elements. Likewise if the moisture level is lower then the depth of the tillage elements can be adjusted correspondingly.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Residue determiner <b>88</b> can be a sensor system that detects the amount of residue on the surface of the ground proximate to implement <b>14</b> or tractor <b>12</b>. In the preferred embodiment residue determiner <b>88</b> estimates the residue mass by calculation using the harvest index applied to and reported from the combine yield data of the previously harvested crop. The harvest index may be in the form of a yield map (discussed below) that provides the crop yield by geographic position. It is assumed that residue mass is proportional to crop yield, so the amount of residue mass is estimated as being proportional to the localized crop yield by the residue determiner <b>88</b>. Since the crop yield varies by location the residue mass varies and this geographically sensitive value is provided to controller <b>80</b> by residue determiner <b>88</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Controller <b>80</b> may be a stand-alone controller (in communication with other controls), or the functions thereof may be incorporated into another controller that may be part of tractor <b>12</b> or implement <b>14</b>. Controller <b>80</b> carries out the functions of method <b>100</b> as well as the already discussed moisture reactive aspect.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Method <b>100</b> is carried out by depth control system <b>76</b>, wherein residue mass information relative to positions in the field to be tilled and slope information relative to positions in the field as well are accessed at steps <b>102</b> and <b>104</b>. The residue mass information may be in the form of a yield map which indicates crop yield by locations within the field. The yield information is gathered and saved by the harvesting unit when the crop is being removed. Where the yield is higher then the residue is proportionately higher. Likewise in sections of the field where the yield is lower the residue is likely lower.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">At step <b>106</b>, residue determiner <b>88</b> uses input from step <b>102</b>, which for example is the yield map, and computes the residue mass (RM) on the ground based on the location of implement <b>14</b> with input from GPS <b>84</b>. Since direction <b>20</b> is known controller <b>80</b> can anticipate what depth to set tillage elements <b>39</b>, <b>60</b>, <b>62</b> and <b>64</b> when the RM changes based on the yield map. This can be done in a continuous resolution of depth or as illustrated in method <b>100</b> when the RM is less than a predetermined amount X of RM as in step <b>110</b>. The residue mass is synonymous with residue cover percentage, which is calculated by using accepted field methods. The two phrases &#x2018;residue mass&#x2019; and &#x2018;residue cover percentage&#x2019; simply denote the amount of surface residue that is present on the ground of the field and using one phrase or the other are interchangeable.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Additionally, the ground slope is determined by topology determiner <b>86</b> at step <b>108</b>. The topological features of the field are availed at step <b>104</b> where the slope features are accessed by controller <b>80</b>. The topological features may be in the form of a topological map with slope information for differing locations in the field. If the ground slope (GS) is greater than a predetermined amount Y at step <b>112</b>, then method <b>100</b> proceeds to step <b>114</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">At step <b>114</b> either the RM has decreased and/or the GS has increased, which causes the tillage depth of the tillage elements to change to a reduced depth. This is desirable so that more of the residue will remain on or close to the surface to reduce erosion in sloped areas and to keep the residue that is there close to the surface in lower yielding areas of the field. If the criteria of steps <b>110</b> and <b>112</b> are not met then method <b>100</b> proceeds to step <b>116</b> where the tillage depth of the tillage elements is reset to a predetermined or set depth.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Advantageously the present invention modifies the tillage depth of the tillage elements reactive to the residue mass and the slope of the field, to proactively work to improve the health and productivity of the soil. Another advantage is that the present invention can generally make use of currently available data and sensors to carry out the steps of method <b>100</b>. Yet another advantage of the present invention is that the information to adjust the depth is available before the implement has arrived at the location that precedes it, so that the depth adjustment can be carried out in anticipation of the location of implement <b>14</b> as it travels across a field. This advantageously can be used to eliminate the reaction time of implement <b>14</b> to a change in depth as actuators <b>68</b> and/or <b>70</b> are activated.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">While this invention has been described with respect to at least one embodiment, the present invention can be further modified within the spirit and scope of this disclosure. This application is therefore intended to cover any variations, uses, or adaptations of the invention using its general principles. Further, this application is intended to cover such departures from the present disclosure as come within known or customary practice in the art to which this invention pertains and which fall within the limits of the appended claims.</p>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND&mdash;FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to headwear, specifically to an improved mechanism for achieving multiple headwear assembly appearances. Headwear has been utilized for thousands of years for protection from the sun and in more recent years, for fashion statements. Present day consumers are often looking for variety in and cost effectiveness of their selection of headwear, which has lead to many variations of the traditional baseball cap and other types of headwear., The present invention allows purchasers to utilize several different headwear assembly appearances with the purchase of only one headwear assembly, while still preserving the functionality of a headwear garment </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND&mdash;DESCRIPTION OF PRIOR ART </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Traditional baseball caps and other types of traditional headwear were manufactured with one crown assembly, one visor, and one size adjustment mechanisms sewn together and utilized for protection (Harrison/O&apos;Brien&mdash;U.S. Pat. No. 911,126 and Pachner&mdash;U.S. Pat. No. 911,432). Previous patents have addressed the novelty issue of recent baseball caps by providing interchangeable insignia patches of sports team logos (Tapia&mdash;U.S. Pat. No. 4,873,726 and 5,070,545), as well as displaying a drawing of a human face with moveable parts (Crowder&mdash;U.S. Pat. No. 2,648,847) Many caps now have detachable components and are also used for decorative purposes, as highlighted by the following patents: Alexander&apos;s Cap with a Removable and Reversible Visor (U.S. Pat. No. 5,613,246), De La Torre&apos;s Three-in-one transformation hats, (U.S. Pat. No. 6,070,270), Sherman&apos;s Reversible Hat Assembly (U.S. Pat. No. 5,181,277), Garza&apos;s Reversible and Size Adjustable Hat (U.S. Pat. No. 5,488,740) and Davis&apos; Cap with Adjustable and Interchangeable Visor Attachments (U.S. Pat. No. 5,898,935). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The present invention overcomes linitations of prior art caps by providing a headwear assembly that includes both a reversible crown assembly and the choice of a single or dual detachable and reversible visor assembly, which is attached to said reversible crown assembly. The dual visor assembly, consisting of one large visor and one smaller connected to the said reversible crown assembly of a headwear assembly, allows the smaller visor the ability to be flipped up. This invention also overcomes limitations of prior art caps by providing four or more major surfaces via screenprinting, embroidery or another similar process for displaying logos, advertisement, sports team emblems or the like without the complexity of using an interchangeable method for displaying said insignias, and thus creating four or more headwear assemblies with one product purchase. In addition, this invention also allows for separate cleaning or replacement of said detachable and reversible single or dual visor assembly or said reversible crown assembly as well as purchase of additional headwear assemblies for mix and match at the wearer&apos;s discretion. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Referring more specifically to the drawings, for illustrative purposes the present invention is generally shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> though <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. It will be appreciated that the apparatus may vary as to configuration and as to details of the parts without departing from the basic concepts as disclosed herein. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> A first embodiment of the headwear assembly illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3</cross-reference> preferably resembles a traditional baseball-style cap, and includes a reversible crown <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and a detachable, reversible single visor <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. A male-female mechanism of detaching the visor from the crown and subsequent reattachment of the visor to the crown is utilized, also allowing for the reversal of the crown and or visor assemblies. The crown has two major opposing surfaces <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, which includes different fabric colors or insignias. The single visor also has two major opposing surfaces <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, which allow for different fabric colors or insignias. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> As best shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, the detachable and reversible single visor assembly <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> includes an arcuate flange which extends upward and is formed along the inside of the first and second major surfaces. A hook and loop fastener assembly <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>B is connected to the arcuate flange of the detachable and reversible visor assembly <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. The anterior portion of the crown assembly <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> has a section which is not sewn together, allowing for hook and loop fastener strips to be attached to the inside the two major opposing surfaces. This hidden attachment process allows the visor and crown assemblies to be detached, reversed and reassembled easily and efficiently, while maintaining the traditional look of the baseball-style cap. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> To display an alternate surface of the preferred embodiment, the wearer must separate the crown from the opposing hook and loop fastener strips which attaches the first major crown surface from the first major visor surface. This action is repeated for the second major surfaces. At this point the wearer can choose to utilize the first major crown surface and the second major visor surface or any other combination of surfaces. After making the selection the hook and loop fastener system is utilized to reattach all the surfaces to again reflect the traditional baseball-style cap. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> As shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, an alternate of the preferred embodiment utilizes a detachable and reversible dual visor assembly <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> and also resembles a baseball-style cap. This headwear assembly includes a reversible crown <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and a detachable, reversible dual visor <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. Visor <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> consists of longer and wider traditional look visor, which is located underneath visor <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, which is a shorter, not as wide visor. Visor <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and visor <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> are sewn together at the flange, allowing for visor <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> to be flipped upwards, if desired (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>). Similarly to the preferred embodiment, a male-female mechanism of detaching the visor from the crown and subsequent reattachment of the visor to the crown is utilized, also allowing for the reversal of the crown and or visor assemblies. Visor <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and visor <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> both have two major opposing surfaces which includes different fabric colors or insignias. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> A second embodiment of the headwear assembly is illustrated in FIGS. <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. Reversible sunvisor crown assembly <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> is attached to the detachable and reversible dual visor <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>. A male-female mechanism of detaching the visor from the crown and subsequent reattachment of the visor to the crown is utilized, also allowing for the reversal of the crown and or visor assemblies. The crown has two major opposing surfaces <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, which includes different fabric colors or insignias. The dual visor also has two major opposing surfaces <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight>, which allow for different fabric colors or insignias. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> A third embodiment of the headwear assembly is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>.

<heading lvl="1">CONCLUSION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> This invention relates to a headwear assembly with two major crown surfaces that can be reversed, with a single or dual visor with two major surfaces that can also be reversed. The invention creates a possibility of obtaining multiple looks out of this single creation. There are two crown sides and two visor sides, which can be utilized, The first crown side can be worn with the first or second visor side, and the second crown side can be worn with the first or second visor side. The invention can be flipped to expose the any side of the cap the wearer wishes to become prominent. The invention can also be worn to display multiple colors, fabrics or insignias on either of the two sides of the crown or either of the two sides of the single or dual visor. The exposed and non-exposed crowns, along with the exposed and non-exposed visors can be made up of different colors, fabrics or insignias, thus creating multiple looks with one product. Insignias can be a logo, advertisement, sports team emblem or the like. The mechanisms utilized for reversing and attaching the crown and visor can be hook and loop fasteners, snaps or other attachment assemblies and are hidden from plain view. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to an article of apparel for a foot that covers the forward portion of the foot only. Embodiments of the present invention provide a partial sock, or half sock, advantageous for uses including wearing with shoes that cover the forward portion of the foot only. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> As footwear fashion trends change, consumers have developed an increased preference for wearing open-heel shoes. Open-heel shoes, including clog-type shoes, may be worn without any type of foot covering, such as socks, inside the shoes. However, many clog-type shoe designs can be uncomfortable when worn without a foot covering between the shoes and feet. Open-heel and clog-type shoes may be uncomfortable for a variety of reasons. For example, the fit of a shoe on a particular person&apos;s foot may cause friction between the inside surface of the shoe and the bare skin of the person&apos;s foot. Minor misalignments in shoe fit and loose-fitting shoes can result in shoe-skin friction causing undesirable skin irritations, such as blisters. Discomfort may also be caused by a natural build-up of moisture from a person&apos;s feet inside shoes. Moisture accumulation inside shoes increases shoe-skin friction and the negative effects of friction on skin. Generally, more moisture is generated in the toe area than in other areas of the foot. As clog-type shoes cover the toe area of the foot and are often constructed from non-breathing materials such as heavy leather and synthetics such as plastic, moisture accumulation can be a particularly difficult problem. In addition, moisture that accumulates inside shoes being worn can cause undesirable odors. As a result, persons wearing open-heel and clog-type shoes often desire to wear foot coverings between the shoes and their feet to absorb moisture and decrease friction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> As described above, ill-fitting shoes can slide on a person&apos;s feet while being worn. Since open-heel shoes have no means in the heel area to anchor the shoes to a person&apos;s feet, open-heel shoes tend to slide off while being worn more easily than shoes having closed heels. Consequently, due to construction design and/or fit, such shoes may move in an undesirable manner, including off a wearer&apos;s feet. Thus, it is often desirable to wear foot coverings inside open-heel and clog-type shoes to improve the fit of the shoes and to decrease the chance of the shoes inadvertently sliding off. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Wearing open-heel shoes without a foot covering inside the shoes can also be uncomfortable in certain climates because a wearer&apos;s feet may get cold. Thus, persons wearing open-heel shoes may prefer to wear foot coverings inside the shoes to help keep their feet warm. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> To compensate for fit, moisture, friction, warmth, and other problems associated with open-heel shoes, traditional foot coverings have been used inside the shoes. However, a drawback of wearing traditional foot coverings with open-heel shoes is that previously available socks extend beyond the tops of the shoes onto the wearer&apos;s heels, ankles, and above. For a sock to show above a shoe is undesirable in many instances. Thus, use of traditional foot coverings, including above-the-ankle and ankle-high socks, with open-heel and clog-type shoes has often been unsatisfactory. For example, on certain occasions when open-heel shoes would be worn as a fashionable style, use of a foot covering that can be seen above the shoes would be contrary to that particular fashion. Therefore, consumers have a need for foot coverings that can be worn inside open-heel and clog-type shoes and that do not show above the tops of the shoes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Foot coverings that do not show above the tops of shoes are useful in other applications as well. For example, a recent fashion trend involves rolling down the tops of socks, particularly ankle-high socks, below the tops of athletic, and other, shoes so as to provide a &ldquo;no show&rdquo; appearance. A &ldquo;no show&rdquo; style produced by rolling down the tops of socks into shoes, while fashionable, creates a problem of excessive sock fabric gathered in a relatively small area at the top margin of shoes. Such an increased thickness of material, which also may be gathered unevenly, may cause discomfort, constriction, unwanted irritation of skin at the affected area, and/or an ill shoe fit. As such, there is a need for foot coverings that do not show above the tops of shoes and that avoid problems, such as discomfort, associated with rolling socks down into shoes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> In the past, low-cut, sheer-type foot coverings have been used, for instance, as disposable foot coverings by customers when trying on shoes in a shoe store. Such sheer foot coverings would not show above the tops of some shoes, but are not suited to overcome fit, moisture, friction, warmth, and other problems associated with open-heel shoes described above. Sheer articles, usually knit on knitting machines having 400, or higher, needle counts, exhibit much slicker surfaces than less tightly knit fabrics, such as cotton and cotton blends typically used in socks. As a result, sheer foot coverings, particularly sheer foot coverings having open heels, tend to slide more easily relative to a foot and the inner surface of a shoe than more loosely knit foot coverings. Such sliding motion disadvantageously allows friction between a foot and shoe, whereas a more loosely knit foot covering may decrease foot-shoe friction. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In addition, previously used sheer foot coverings of partial length have also not had elastic materials incorporated into the middle area of the article, resulting in such sheer foot coverings tending to slide on a foot. Sheer articles also possess minimal moisture absorbency characteristics as compared to more loosely knit foot coverings, such as cotton socks, for example. Furthermore, sheer articles are substantially thinner and are much less able to provide a thickness sufficient to enhance fit and warmth than are more loosely knit fabrics, as in typical cotton socks. For these and other reasons, sheer foot coverings have not met consumers&apos; needs for foot coverings that can be worn inside open-heel and clog-type shoes, that do not show above the tops of the shoes, and are comfort-fitting. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Other foot coverings that may not show above the tops of shoes also fail to meet such needs. For example, foot coverings made for purposes of insulation against cold and moisture and used in athletic footwear, such as skiing boots, may not show above the tops of the boots. Such sock structures are often made with materials, like neoprene, and with a thickness to provide for insulation that precludes any practical use with open-heel shoes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Another disadvantage of previously available foot coverings that provide only partial foot coverage is construction with multiple seams. Use of multiple seams in a sock that covers the forward portion of a foot increases friction points between the foot, sock, and shoe. Foot coverings that do not show above the tops of open-heel shoes and that are comfort-fitting would need to minimize friction points due to seams. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, there remains a need for a foot covering that covers the forward portion of a foot, that does not show above the tops of shoes, and that enhances fit and comfort of wearing shoes. There is also a need for a foot covering that covers the forward portion of a foot inside open-heel and clog-type shoes, that does not show above the tops of the shoes, and that overcomes the disadvantages related to fit, moisture, friction, and warmth associated with wearing no foot coverings and traditional foot coverings. There is also a need for a comfort-fitting foot covering that covers the forward portion of a foot inside open-heel and clog-type shoes, that does not show above the tops of the shoes, and that can be easily and economically manufactured and used. It is to these perceived needs that the present invention is directed. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to an article of apparel for a foot that covers the forward portion of the foot only. In an embodiment, the present invention comprises a foot covering that does not show above the tops of shoes and that enhances fit and comfort of wearing shoes, particularly open-heel and clog-type shoes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> In an embodiment of the present invention, a foot covering comprises toe, middle, and top portions. Embodiments of a partial sock foot covering comprise a length that extends only to the middle, or arch, area of a foot, and that does not show above the tops of shoes worn over the partial sock. Embodiments of foot coverings of the present invention comprise a thickness appropriate to assist a wearer with proper fit of shoes, to absorb moisture, and to reduce friction, and that can be comfortably used during all seasons of the year. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Embodiments of the present invention preferably comprise only one seam, for example, a toe seam on the upper surface of a sock. A toe seam differentiates the upper surface and the bottom surface of the sock and assists wearers in orienting such a sock for proper placement on their feet and thereby achieve better fit and comfort. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Partial sock foot coverings of the present invention may be include a variety of materials, such as cotton and cotton blends, which allow such partial socks to be comfortably worn during all seasons of the year. Embodiments of the present invention comprise elastomeric materials that increase the gripping force, fit, and tendency of such a sock to stay on a wearer&apos;s feet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> In embodiments of the present invention, a partial sock comprises a band extending from the proximal margin of the top portion. A band may include elastic material, which provides additional gripping force to help secure the sock in place on a wearer&apos;s foot. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> In the present invention, embodiments of foot coverings that do not show above the tops of shoes comprise various sizes, colors, and designs and different lengths to accommodate different shoe constructions. Partial socks of the present invention comprise sizes proportioned to the forward portion of a foot to be covered by the sock. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> Foot coverings of the present invention may be constructed using traditional sock manufacturing methods and techniques, for example, with a seamed toe closure on conventional circular knitting machinery. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> In embodiments of the present invention, a partial sock comprises a &ldquo;sling,&rdquo; or strap attached to opposite sides of the top portion of the sock. The strap provides a loop for fitting around a person&apos;s heel as a means for maintaining a partial sock on the person&apos;s foot. A heel strap can be permanently or removably attached to the sock using a variety of attachment means. Embodiments of heel straps comprise various materials, including elastomeric materials and/or transparent materials. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Features of foot coverings of the present invention may be accomplished singularly, or in combination, in one or more of the embodiments of the present invention. As will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art, the present invention has wide utility in a number of applications as illustrated by the variety of features and advantages discussed below. For example, the present invention advantageously provides foot coverings that cover the forward portion of a foot, leave the heel of a foot uncovered, and do not show above the tops of shoes. Thus, embodiments of the present invention provide a &ldquo;no show&rdquo; foot covering. As a result, foot coverings of the present invention may be worn with open-heel and clog-type shoes without exposing the foot covering above the tops of the shoes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> Another advantage of foot coverings of the present invention is that such partial socks can enhance the fit of ill-fitting shoes. Additionally, such partial foot coverings may help prevent shoes having no anchoring means at the heel, such as open-heel and clog-type shoes, from sliding off a wearer&apos;s foot. Consequently, foot coverings of the present invention enhance a wearer&apos;s comfort when wearing otherwise ill-fitting shoes or open-heel and clog-type shoes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> Another advantage of the present invention is that foot coverings that do not show above the tops of shoes, and would be desirable for wearing with open-heel shoes, absorb moisture and reduce friction between feet and shoes. Absorption of moisture, especially in the toe area, and reduction of friction between feet and shoes generally increase comfort. For example, as partial socks of the present invention absorb moisture and help keep feet dry, a wearer&apos;s feet have less tendency to stick to shoes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides the advantage of a foot covering that, while not showing above the tops of shoes, may provide warmth to a wearer&apos;s feet. Foot coverings of the present invention may be advantageously constructed with appropriate materials, knit density, thickness, and other factors so that such partial socks can be worn during all seasons of the year. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> Another advantage of the present invention is that a &ldquo;no show&rdquo; foot covering is provided that is easy to put on by a wearer. Ease of placement of partial socks of the present invention is facilitated by the further advantage of having a toe seam on the upper surface of the socks that differentiates the upper and bottom surfaces of the socks. Differentiation of upper and bottom surfaces allows wearers to orient, and thus place, such socks on more easily. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> Another advantage of foot coverings of the present invention is that such partial socks may be constructed so as to enhance the ability of the socks to stay on a person&apos;s feet when shoes are removed. The ability of partial socks to stay on a person&apos;s feet when shoes are removed is enhanced by appropriate sizing of such socks for particular wearers. In embodiments of the present invention, partial socks advantageously utilize elastic materials in part or all of the sock to help maintain the sock in place on the wearer&apos;s foot. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> In the present invention, partial foot coverings provide the advantage of application with various types of shoes and in a variety of settings. As discussed above, partial foot coverings can be used with athletic shoes to provide a &ldquo;no show&rdquo; appearance, while also overcoming disadvantages of the practice of rolling traditional socks down inside shoes to achieve a similar look. Partial socks of the present invention provide the advantages of enhanced fit and decreased moisture and friction with the advantage of a &ldquo;no show&rdquo; look for a dressier appearance with fashion open-heel shoes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> Another advantage of the present invention is that foot coverings that cover only the forward portion of a foot increases comfort by avoiding a &ldquo;binding&rdquo; effect of the stretch of a sock from toes to heel. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Still another advantage of the present invention is that partial foot coverings that provide the above benefits can be easily and economically made using conventional manufacturing methods and techniques. The present invention overcomes disadvantages related to fit, moisture, friction, and warmth associated with wearing no foot coverings and traditional foot coverings by providing comfort-fitting, &ldquo;no show&rdquo; foot coverings that are also affordable to consumers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> As will be realized by those of skill in the art, many different embodiments of an article of apparel for the foot that covers the forward portion of the foot only according to the present invention are possible. For example, in addition to an embodiment of the present invention described herein as a half sock, the present invention may also comprise a sock that covers the forward three-fourths of a foot, the heel remaining open. Additional uses, objects, advantages, and novel features of the invention are set forth in the detailed description that follows and will become more apparent to those skilled in the art upon examination of the following or by practice of the invention.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In an embodiment of the present invention, a foot covering comprises toe, middle, and top portions. The foot covering has a length such that the top portion extends only to the middle, or arch, area of a foot. In other embodiments, the top portion of a foot covering extends to a location on a foot more proximal to the heel. A foot covering of the present invention may thus be described as a partial sock, half sock, or demi-sock. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> In the present invention, embodiments of a foot covering have a length that does not show above the tops of shoes worn over the foot covering and that fits comfortably on a foot for which it is made. Embodiments of foot coverings of the present invention comprise a thickness appropriate to assist a wearer with proper fit of shoes, to absorb moisture, and to reduce friction. Such embodiments of the present invention provide a comfort fit, including desirable moisture absorption and friction reduction characteristics, while avoiding being too bulky for wearing with open-heel shoes. Additionally, in embodiments, foot coverings of the present invention comprise a thickness that can be comfortably used during all seasons of the year. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Embodiments of the present invention are preferably constructed with only one seam, for example, a toe seam on the upper surface of the sock. A toe seam on the upper surface of a partial sock, as in the present invention, would differentiate the upper surface and the bottom surface, or sole, of the sock. Differentiation of the upper and bottom surfaces of a partial sock assists wearers in orienting such a sock for proper placement on their feet and thereby achieve better fit and comfort. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> In embodiments of the present invention, a partial sock comprises a band extending downward from the proximal margin of the top portion. Preferably, a top band extends downward from the proximal margin for one inch or more. Such a band may be knit as a mock rib. In embodiments, a band comprises elastic material or materials. A band at the proximal margin of the top portion of a partial sock, as in the present invention, provides additional gripping force to help secure the sock in place on a wearer&apos;s foot. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> Foot coverings of the present invention may be constructed using traditional sock manufacturing methods and techniques. For example, a partial sock may be flat knit with a seamed toe closure on conventional circular knitting machinery. In embodiments of the present invention, fabrication of a partial sock includes programming equipment for and discontinuing knitting, at a length to produce, for example, a half, or partial, sock. Partial socks of the present invention may be knit using 400 needle, or higher, knitting machines. In other embodiments, partial socks of the present invention may be produced on knitting machines with fewer needles, for example, 84, 108, and 132 needle machines. In embodiments, partial socks of the present invention are manufactured having a seamless toe closure. While conventional manufacturing methods and techniques may be used to make partial socks as in the present invention, such foot coverings have not been previously made. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> Foot coverings of the present invention may be constructed with a variety of materials. For example, cotton and cotton blended with nylon, polyester, and/or other materials may be used. Embodiments of the present invention comprise such cotton blends to enhance strength and durability of the partial sock. Use of materials, including such cotton blends, in the present invention provides partial socks that can be comfortably worn during all seasons of the year. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> In embodiments of the present invention, elastomeric yarn is utilized throughout a sock, including the toe, middle, and top portions, to increase the gripping force and fit of the sock on a wearer&apos;s foot. Elastomeric materials, such as spandex, may be knit, or incorporated using other conventional techniques, into the fabric of a partial sock. Use of elastic materials provides a partial sock with increased tendency to stay on a wearer&apos;s feet when shoes are removed. In other embodiments, elastomeric yarns are used in less than an entire partial sock, for example, limited to the middle, or arch, and top portions only. In embodiments, a tighter stitch in the band, top portion, and/or middle portion increases the ability of a partial sock to grip a wearer&apos;s foot. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> In the present invention, embodiments of foot coverings that do not show above the tops of shoes comprise various sizes and colors. Embodiments of a partial sock, as in the present invention, include standard sizes for women&apos;s&apos;, men&apos;s&apos;, and children&apos;s&apos; feet, as well as other sizes. Partial sock sizes include standard sizes used in the United States, Europe, Japan, and other countries. Embodiments of partial socks of the present invention comprise different lengths to accommodate different shoe constructions. Moreover, partial socks comprise sizes in proportion to the forward portion of a foot to be covered by the sock. In embodiments of the present invention, partial socks comprise colors including white, a range of other colors, and combinations of colors and/or designs. Such colors and/or designs may be intended for particular uses, for example, designating the color, name, and/or logo of an athletic team. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> In embodiments of the present invention, a partial sock comprises a &ldquo;sling,&rdquo; or strap. One end of the strap is attached to the medial aspect and the opposite end is attached to the lateral aspect of the top portion near the proximal margin of the sock. Preferably, the strap is attached to the top portion near and/or on the bottom surface a sock. The strap extends from one point of attachment to the other to provide a loop for fitting around a person&apos;s heel. The length of the strap is sized to fit snugly around a person&apos;s heel so that when in place, the strap provides a means for maintaining a partial sock on the person&apos;s foot. In experimental wear testing, 64% of participants found that partial socks of the present invention stayed in place when worn with shoes. A heel strap provides added security for retaining a partial sock for those unaccustomed to a short sock and/or those who perceive a partial sock might move out of position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> In embodiments of partial socks, a heel strap is attached to a sock using one, or a combination, of various conventional stitch patterns. For example, a heel strap can be effectively attached to a partial sock using a &ldquo;bar tacking&rdquo; technique for making strong point attachments. Alternatively, heel straps can be attached to partial socks using other means, such as by hand sewing. In other embodiments, heel straps comprise means for attaching and detaching the strap from a partial sock. As examples, a heel strap can be removably attached to a partial sock using buttons, snaps, or hook and loop-type fasteners. In still other embodiments, the present invention comprises a partial sock having a heel strap integrally made into the structure of the sock. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> Partial socks of the present invention include embodiments having heel straps comprising various materials. For example, a heel strap of the present invention may comprise the same material as the partial sock to which the heel strap is attached. In embodiments, heel straps comprise cotton, polyester, nylon, spandex, and combinations thereof. Preferably, heel straps of the present invention include an elastomeric material to provide some degree of stretch for fitting the strap around a wearer&apos;s heel. In embodiments, heel straps comprise a transparent material so as to allow the color of the wearer&apos;s skin to show through the strap. A stretchable, transparent polyurethane material may be used for this purpose. Heel straps comprising such polymeric materials can be attached to a partial sock using thermal transfer techniques, such as with an ultrasonic heat transfer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Embodiments of heel straps include various designs. For example, heel straps may be screen-printed, have powder adhered to the surface, contain reflective material, have lace attached, comprise various colors, display logos, etc. Embodiments of heel straps comprise various widths, from a narrow, shoestring-like width to a width sufficient to cover an entire heel. In preferred embodiments, heel straps are between one-fourth and one inch wide. In embodiments, heel straps of the present invention comprise a means for adjusting the length, or tension, of the strap. For example, two ends of a heel strap may be looped through a clasp, which can be used to adjust the length of the strap. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0046" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0046&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, in embodiments of the present invention, a foot covering, or article of apparel for a foot, comprises a sock <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> having a toe portion <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>, a middle portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, a top portion <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, and a length <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> extending from toe portion <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to top portion <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. The length <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of sock <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> terminates at a location distal to heel area <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> on the foot so as to leave heel <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> uncovered. Preferably, sock length <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is less than a length of an open heel shoe (not shown) so that when sock <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is worn with the open heel shoe, sock <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is contained completely within the shoe. As such, embodiments of the present invention comprise a sock length <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> that does not show above the tops of shoes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0047" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0047&rsqb;</number> In embodiments, sock <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> comprises a thickness sufficient to promote proper fit of the open heel shoe on a wearer. In addition to assisting a wearer with proper fit of shoes, such thickness preferably helps absorb moisture and reduce friction. In embodiments, sock <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> comprises a thickness that can be comfortably used during all seasons of the year. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0048" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0048&rsqb;</number> Sock <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may comprise cotton and/or cotton blends. For example, sock <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may include cotton and cotton blended with nylon, polyester, and/or other materials. Such materials enhance strength and durability of the sock and allow partial socks of the present invention to be comfortably worn during all seasons of the year. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0049" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0049&rsqb;</number> In other embodiments, sock <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> comprises elastomeric material in top portion <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>, middle portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, and/or toe portion <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Elastomeric yarn increases the gripping force and fit of sock <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> on a wearer&apos;s foot and thus increases the tendency for sock <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to stay on a wearer&apos;s foot while worn with a shoe and when a shoe is removed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0050" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0050&rsqb;</number> The present invention includes embodiments having a top portion <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> of sock <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> further comprising a band <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> of material extending from proximal margin <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of top portion <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. Such a band <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> provides additional gripping force and promotes removably securing sock <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to a foot. Preferably, top band <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> extends from proximal margin <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> for one inch or more. Top portion <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and band <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> may both include elastomeric material. In some embodiments, band <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> comprises a greater amount of elastomeric material than the remainder of top portion <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. Such a band <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> may be knit as a mock rib. In embodiments, band <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> may include a tighter stitch than the remainder of the sock. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0051" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0051&rsqb;</number> In embodiments, sock <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> comprises an upper surface <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and a bottom surface <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, or sole, and a seam <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> on upper surface <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> of toe portion <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. Embodiments of the present invention preferably comprise only one seam, for example, a toe seam <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> on upper surface <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> of sock <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. A toe seam on the upper surface of a partial sock, as in the present invention, differentiates upper surface <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight> and bottom surface <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of sock <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Differentiation of the upper and bottom surfaces of a partial sock assists wearers in orienting such a sock for proper placement on their feet and thereby achieve better fit and comfort. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0052" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0052&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, embodiments of sock <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> further comprise a strap <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> having opposite ends, one end of which is shown at <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>. Each end <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is attached to an opposite side of top portion <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> near proximal margin <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> of sock <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to provide a loop for fitting strap <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> around heel <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, end <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> is shown attached to the medial aspect of sock <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> on top portion <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> near and/or on bottom surface <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Not shown is the opposite end of strap <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, which is attached in the same or similar position on the lateral aspect of sock <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Preferably, strap <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> comprises a length sized to fit snugly around heel <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> so that when in place, strap <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> provides a means for maintaining sock <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> on a foot. Heel straps <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> comprise a width sufficient to comfortably and/or decoratively hold a partial sock in place. In preferred embodiments, the width of strap <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is between one-fourth and one inch wide. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0053" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0053&rsqb;</number> In embodiments, strap <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> comprises elastomeric material, which helps provide stretch for a snug fit and added security for retaining a partial sock on a wearer&apos;s foot. In embodiments, strap <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> comprises a transparent material, which is advantageous for allowing the color of a wearer&apos;s skin to show through the strap. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0054" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0054&rsqb;</number> Strap <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of the present invention can be permanently attached to sock <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> in various ways, including stitching with various patterns. In embodiments, strap <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> comprises a means for removably attaching strap <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to sock <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, such as with buttons, snaps, or hook and loop-type fasteners. In other embodiments, a partial sock comprises a heel strap <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> integrally made into the structure of sock <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Strap <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> may further include a means for adjusting the length, or tension, of the strap, such as looping strap <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> through a clasp (not shown). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0055" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0055&rsqb;</number> Experimental wear testing with two focus groups demonstrated optimal design characteristics for best performance of partial socks according to the present invention. Testing showed, for example, that increasing thickness in a cushioned embodiment provides increased comfort, though too great a thickness decreases fit inside a shoe. When comparing partial socks of the present invention made on knitting machines having 132 needles, 108 needles, and 84 needles, wearers reported generally more comfort with partial socks made on the lower needle count machines. Test data showed that a wider band having an increased amount of elastic material at the proximal margin of the top portion provides an improved grip against a wearer&apos;s foot, and the partial sock having a band of about one inch was better retained on a foot. The partial socks were rated as comfortable by 73% of participants. Thus, the present invention provides an article of apparel for a foot that covers the forward portion of the foot only, that does not show above the tops of shoes, and that enhances fit and comfort of wearing shoes, particularly open-heel and clog-type shoes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0056" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0056&rsqb;</number> Although the present invention has been described with reference to particular embodiments, it should be recognized that these embodiments are merely illustrative of the principles of the present invention. Those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the partial sock of the present invention may be constructed and implemented in other ways and embodiments. Accordingly, the description herein should not be read as limiting the present invention, as other embodiments also fall within the scope of the present invention. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to a sock for an infant and, in particular, to a sock designed to provide additional traction for a crawling infant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Dressing an infant with fabric socks is advantageous in many ways. Socks are aesthetically pleasing, keep the infant&apos;s feet warm and protect the infant&apos;s feet from minor cuts and abrasions. When the infant becomes ambulatory, however, socks can be disadvantageous on smooth floor surfaces, such as hardwood or linoleum floors, because there is a very low coefficient of friction between fabric material of the socks and the floor surface. This poses an increased risk of injury because the infant may slip and fall on the smooth surface while wearing only the fabric socks. Dressing the infant with shoes is one solution to this problem, but it is not always desirable, and is often difficult, to put shoes on an ambulatory infant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> This is a recognized problem, and many prior art infants socks, therefore, have been fitted with material that provides greater traction on the bottom of the sock. This material is also referred to as a gripper area. These prior art socks have worked well for those infants who have already progressed to walking, because the portion of the sock with the gripper area is in contact with the smooth floor surface. These prior art socks, however, have been disadvantageous for crawling infants, because typically the feet of crawling infants contact the floor surface with portion of the foot closest to the toes or the top of the foot, rather than the bottom of the foot. Because the top portion of the prior art socks did not contain a gripper area on the toes or top of the sock, the same problems were encountered as with socks without any gripper area, which results in an increased risk of injury to crawling infants wearing the prior art socks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> It is desirable to provide an infant sock that will provide greater traction for crawling infants as well as for infants that are already walking. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> It is an object of this invention, therefore, to provide an infant sock suitable for both crawling and walking infants with a decreased risk of injury to the crawling infant wearing the sock. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The present invention concerns an infant sock for use with a crawling infant. The infant sock includes a tubular sock member with an upper surface, a lower surface, and a toe portion connecting and enclosing the upper and lower surfaces at a leading edge of the sock member. At the opposite end of the tubular sock member, the upper surface and lower surface form an open end for receiving a foot. A gripper area is attached to the exterior portion of the sock member and preferably extends from the upper surface to the toe area and further to the lower surface. The gripper area is preferably a single piece of frictional material that covers an area along the lower surface, and a lesser area on the upper surface. The gripper is preferably attached to the fabric of the sock member by a thermal process. The sock member preferably includes an elastic member at the open end to keep the sock in place on the infant&apos;s foot and lower leg. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the sock member is advantageously foot-shaped for ease of dressing the infant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> Alternatively, the gripper area is formed in a tread pattern and can include transversely or circumferentially spaced ribs along the upper surface, toe portion, and lower surface. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The present invention recognizes that prior art socks were suitable neither for providing traction to crawling infants nor for reducing the risk of injury to crawling infants on smooth floor surfaces. With a gripper area at the top surface and toe portion of the sock member, the present invention provides infants wearing the present invention a greater ability to crawl on smooth surfaces, while reducing the risk of injury to crawling infants. The present invention is also suitable for infants who have progressed to walking, because the gripper area extends to the lower surface of the sock member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The present invention is a novel improvement over the prior art because while the prior art teaches many different varieties of infant socks, none of the prior art teaches an infant sock with a gripper area extending to the toe and the upper surface of the sock member for the purpose of providing traction to crawling infants.</paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0001" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0001&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates to a suspension, and particularly, to a suspension for protective headgear such as a protective helmet. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> Most types of protective headgear worn by workers to protect them from head injury have a suspension system. The suspension system, along with the helmet itself, act to absorb the shock of an impact with any object striking the worker&apos;s head. The suspension system is also used to position the helmet on the worker&apos;s head. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The suspension is often a web-like support system comprising several strips of material that are arranged to cross each other. The ends of the strips are, for example, attached at four or more points around the circumference of the helmet. A band or headband is then typically attached to the four or more points of the suspension to permit the helmet to be worn by the worker. To securely position the helmet on the worker&apos;s head, it is essential that the circumference of the headband be adjustable to fit the appropriate head size. A napestrap is often attached at a rearward end of the band to achieve these results. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> For example, in the Staz-On&reg; Suspension from Mine Safety Appliances Company of Pittsburgh, Pa., and described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,500,474 and 5,896,586 a headband, and more particularly, the napestrap portion of the headband, is manually adjusted by the wearer to fit the appropriate head size. The two ends of the band are connected and held in place by a slot-and-teeth arrangement. In the Fas-Trac&reg; Suspension from Mine Safety Appliances Company, and described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,942,628 and 5,950,245, a ratchet-type mechanism is used to control the fit of the headband. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> In commercially available suspensions for use with protective headgear, the supporting webbing and the headband are generally fabricated from three or more components, requiring relatively expensive and time consuming assembly. It is, therefore, desirable to develop a suspension for protective headgear which is comfortable, easily adjustable to the head size of the user, as well as simple and inexpensive to manufacture. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Generally, the present invention provides a suspension for use in protective headgear. The suspension comprises a headband section to encompass at least a part of a user&apos;s head and a crown support section connected to the headband section. The crown support section is adapted to extend over the crown of a person&apos;s head during use of the suspension. The headband section and the crown support section of the suspension are fabricated from an integral piece of material. As used herein, the term &ldquo;integral&rdquo; and the phrase &ldquo;integral piece of material&rdquo; refer to a single piece of material that is a seamless whole. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the suspension is fabricated from an integral piece of polymeric material. Preferably, the polymeric suspension is molded in a generally flat mold. The headband section preferably comprises at least a first opening or disconnection therein and a second opening or disconnection therein during molding to facilitate generally flat molding. Fabricating the suspension of the present invention from an integral piece of material, and particularly a generally flat, integral piece of molded polymeric material, greatly reduces the labor and manufacturing costs associated with protective headgear. Moreover, because the suspension of the present invention is molded in a generally flat, disconnected state, it can be easily stacked for storage and/or shipment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The suspension preferably further comprises attachment tabs for attaching the suspension to the shell of the protective helmet. These attachment tabs are preferably formed integrally with the remainder of the suspension (that is, the tabs are part of the integral piece of material) The crown support section of the suspension of the present invention preferably comprises at least two crown straps connected at a first end thereof to the headband section and connected at a second end thereof to a generally central section. The generally central section is preferably adapted to contact the top of the user&apos;s head during use of the suspension. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> A portion of the crown support section preferably deforms when the protective headgear has sustained an impact of a certain force. Preferably, a portion of at least one of the crown straps deforms when the protective headgear has sustained an impact of a certain force. This deformation of a portion of the crown support section acts to absorb some of the energy of the impact. Preferably, the portion of the crown support section deforms sufficiently to provide a readily visible indication that the protective headgear has sustained the impact. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> For example, the portion of the crown support section that deforms may comprise a first opening in the crown strap that visibly deforms when the protective headgear has sustained an impact. That portion of the crown support section may also comprise a second opening adjacent the first opening. In this embodiment, a strip of material between the first opening and the second opening is preferably adapted to break when the protective headgear has sustained an impact of a certain force. Additional holes may also create high stress areas that deform and/or break when the protective headgear has sustained an impact of a certain force. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The present invention also provides a suspension including a headband comprising an elastomeric portion. The inventors of the present invention have discovered that a headband comprising a length of even slightly elastomeric material greatly increases the comfort of the user when compared to certain commercially available suspension systems. Moreover, the present inventors have discovered a length of elastomeric material can be incorporated into a headband of a suspension for protective headgear while still complying with Top Impact Standard ANSI Z89.1-1997 for such protective headgear. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, the length of the elastomeric material spanning the opening in the headband section is preferably adjustable to adjust the fit of the suspension. In another embodiment, the opening is closed and the headband section is provided with a mechanism for attaching the elastomeric material. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> In the suspension described above, for example, a limited elastomeric band or portion may span the first opening of the headband section. This limited elastomeric band section contacts the forehead of the user. The limited forward elastomeric band section is preferably formed from a material which is suitable to cushion the user&apos;s head and may also act as a sweatband. Alternatively, the two front arms of the headband section may be connected together, eliminating the first opening. This section is then covered with a soft flexible material to cushion the user&apos;s head and also act as a sweatband. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> The present invention also provides a forward band section comprising in one embodiment a first or forward section to contact the forehead of the user and a second or upward section adapted to be positioned between the user&apos;s head and the crown support section of the suspension during use thereof. The forward band section is preferably formed from a material suitable to cushion the user&apos;s head. The first section of the forward band section and the second section of the forward band section are preferably formed from an integral piece of material. Unlike prior forward bands or sweatbands incorporated into protective headgear, the second section of the forward band section of the present invention cushions the top of the user&apos;s head from contact with the crown support section of the suspension, thereby substantially increasing the comfort of the user. As described above, the forward band section is preferably elastic in nature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> The present invention also provides protective helmets comprising suspension systems and/or forward band sections as described above. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">Detailed Description of the Invention </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1, a</cross-reference> suspension <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> for use in a protective helmet <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2, 3A</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>B) is preferably formed from an integral piece of material. Preferably, the material is a moldable polymeric material having a modulus in the range of approximately 20,000 to 50,000 psi, more preferably in the range of approximately 30,000 to 40,000 psi. As is clear to one skilled in the art, the range of preferred moduli can be changed if the dimensions (for example, thickness) of suspension <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> are changed. An example of a suitable material is polyethylene. Suspension <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> comprises a headband section <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</cross-reference>) to encompass at least a part of the side of a user&apos;s head and a crown support section <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</cross-reference>) connected to headband section <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Crown support section <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> extends over the crown of the user&apos;s head during use of suspension <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> As further illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, suspension <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is preferably formed such that headband section <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> comprises a first forward end <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>A and a second forward end <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>B with a first opening <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>C therebetween. After molding, first forward end <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>A and second forward end <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>B may be connected together in forming the headband of suspension <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In connecting first forward end <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>A and second forward end <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>B, suspension <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> begins to take a three-dimensional domed shape as best illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, first forward end <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>A and second forward end <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>B are not directly connected together when suspension <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is in a connected state (illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</cross-reference>). In that regard, headband section <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> preferably further comprises a forward band <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> that connects between first forward end <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>A and second forward end <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>B to span first opening <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>C. Forward band <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> is preferably connected to span first opening <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>C via tabs <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>B on first forward end <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>A and second forward end <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>B, respectively. Tabs <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>B preferably cooperate with slots <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>510</bold></highlight>B, respectively, of forward band <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> to removably incorporate forward band <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> into headband section <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Headband section <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> preferably further comprises tabs <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>C and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>D that cooperate with holes or slots <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>520</bold></highlight>B, respectively, to further retain forward band <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> within headband section <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. Forward band <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> preferably acts to cushion the fit of headband section <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> on the user&apos;s head and as a sweatband to absorb perspiration of the user. Forward band <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> is discussed in further detail below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, headband section <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> comprises a nape strap <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> on the rearward side thereof that extends around the base of the user&apos;s head as best illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. Before connection, nape strap <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> comprises a first rearward end section <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>A and a second rearward end section <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>B, forming a second opening <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>C therebetween. Second rearward end section <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>B may, for example, comprise a tab <highlight><bold>55</bold></highlight> that cooperates with one of a plurality of slots or holes <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> in first rearward end section <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>A to connect first rearward end section <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>A and second rearward end section <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>B and to adjust the fit of headband <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to the user&apos;s head. Other manners of connecting first rearward end section <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>A and second rearward end section <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>B to adjust the fit of headband <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to the user&apos;s head such as with a ratchet mechanism are known in the art and are equally suitable for use in the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> Fabricating suspension <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> such that headband section <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is separated in the front (relative to the user, i.e., the right side in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) to form first opening <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>C and separated in the rear (i.e., left side of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>) to form second opening <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>C enables one to make suspension <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> as generally flat or two-dimensional in a disconnected state. This generally flat profile enables the molding of suspension <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> out of a polymeric material in a generally flat mold, greatly simplifying the fabrication of suspension <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and decreasing the cost thereof as compared to commercially available suspensions for use with protective headgear. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> The flat profile of suspension <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> also facilitates the stacking of a plurality of such suspensions for storage and/or shipment. Under current practice, suspensions are typically attached to a protective helmet and the helmets (with suspension therein) are shipped in individual boxes. Because of the flat profile of suspension <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and the ease with which suspension <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can be attached to or removed from helmet <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, suspension <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> and helmet <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can be readily shipped in a disconnected state. In that regard, helmet <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is preferably formed such that a plurality of such helmets can be stacked/nested for ease of storage and/or shipment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> Crown support section <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of suspension <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> preferably comprises crown straps <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>A, <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>B, <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>C and <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>D. Crown straps <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>A through <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>D preferably connect headband section <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> to a generally central section <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. Generally central section <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is preferably formed to contact the top of the user&apos;s head during use of suspension <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. In the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, each of crown straps <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>A through <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>D is attached to each of a first generally circular portion <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>A and a second generally circular portion <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>B that comprise generally central section <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> Suspension <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> preferably further comprises an attachment mechanism for attaching suspension <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to helmet <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. As discussed above, the attachment mechanism preferably allows easy attachment and disconnection of suspension <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Preferably, the attachment mechanism is formed integrally with the remainder of suspension <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. For example, suspension <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> may comprises tabs <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>A through <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>D on the ends of crown straps <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>A through <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>D for readily and removably attaching suspension <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> to helmet <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> Tabs <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>A through <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>D preferably cooperate with corresponding ports <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> on helmet <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Tabs <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>A through <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>D preferably seat in corresponding ports <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> such that suspension <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> resists removal from helmet <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> during use thereof, but can be removed from helmet <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> when not in use. As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</cross-reference>, ports <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> preferably comprise a channel <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>A formed by flanges <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>C. Within channel <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>A is an abutment member or wall <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>B on each side of channel <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>A against which tabs <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>A through <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>D rest when helmet <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is in use. A central section <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>A&prime; of channel <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>A preferably extends farther upward past abutment members <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>B to seat a lower portion of crown straps <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>A through <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>D. When helmet <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is not in use, suspension <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is easily removable therefrom by simply sliding tabs <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>A through <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>D downward and out of ports <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> The present inventors have discovered that a length of elastomeric material can be incorporated into headband <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of suspension <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> or other suspensions to greatly increase the comfort of the user thereof while safely and fully complying with Top Impact Standard ANSI Z89.1-1997 for protective headgear such as helmet <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. Preferably, the length of elastic material is relatively easily stretched or expanded. For example, a material having a stretch rate of approximately &frac14; inch to approximately 3 inches per pound is suitable for use in the present invention. More preferably, the stretch rate is in the range of approximately &frac12; inch to 2 inches per pound. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> It is not necessary that the total amount of stretch afforded by the elastic material be great. Providing only a small amount of flexibility or stretch in headband section <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> can greatly increase the comfort of the user. Elasticity or stretch in headband section <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> of suspension <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, for example, allows the headband section to expand and contract when forces are applied to suspension <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Moreover, the &ldquo;vice clamping&rdquo; effect commonly experienced with certain commercially available suspensions when the head of the user expands during heavy work is greatly reduced or eliminated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> In one embodiment, forward band section <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> can be fabricated to provide elasticity. Forward band section <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> may, for example, comprise a first layer fabricated from a nylon scrim. Such a material is elastic in nature while also providing strength. A nylon scrim also allows moisture to pass therethrough. The strength of the elastic material incorporated into headband section <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is not a great concern, however, if protection against substantial side impacts is not a concern. The first layer can, for example, be placed against the user&apos;s forehead in warm weather to allow the sweat of the user to pass therethrough while maintaining a dry surface. A second layer of forward band section <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> adjacent to the first layer is preferably fabricated from a foam material to provide cushioning and adsorb perspiration. A third layer, adjacent to the second layer on a side thereof opposite to the first layer is also preferably provided. The third layer may, for example, be fabricated from a polyester with a napped or knitted finish. The first layer and the third layer are preferably provided with holes or passages therein to facilitate heat and mass (that is, moisture) transfer therethrough. As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</cross-reference> forward band section <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> is preferably folded over on itself in the area of the users forehead during use to provide additional padding and comfort. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> Forward band section <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> is easily removable from within headband section <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> Because forward band section <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> is preferably formed to be symmetrical in shape, it is also easily reversible within headband section <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. For example, in warm weather, the user of helmet <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can incorporate forward band section <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> into headband section <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> such that the first layer is against the user&apos;s forehead as described above. In cold weather, forward band section <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> may be reversed to place the highly insulating, polyester, third layer against the forehead of the user. As is clear to one skilled in the art, forward band section <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> is also easily replaceable after extended use thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> An elastic material can also, for example, be incorporated into the rear of a suspension of the present invention. For example, suspension <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> is somewhat similar to suspension <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> (with like parts numbered accordingly the same). However, nape strap <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> of suspension <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> comprises a first rearward end section <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>A and a second rearward end section <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>B that are shortened as compared to first rearward end section <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>A and second rearward end section <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>B of suspension <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, first section <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>A and second section <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>B may be connected or spanned via an elastomeric strap <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> when suspension <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> is assembled into it&apos;s three-dimensional form. Alternatively, first rearward end section <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>A and second rearward end section <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight>B of suspension <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> can be used in the suspension <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> The length of elastomeric strap <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> between first section <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>A and second section <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>B may be adjusted (to fit the head size of an individual user) via buckles <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>B (as known in the art) formed on the distal ends of first section <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>A and second section <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>B, respectively. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> In another embodiment, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, first forward end <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>A and second forward end <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>B are directly connected together when suspension <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is in a connected state (such as is illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</cross-reference>). Any number of connection mechanisms can be used. A preferred one, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, includes a male member <highlight><bold>33</bold></highlight> in the shape of an arrow with a slit down the middle and a female member <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> including a ridge with an opening therein such that the arrow can be inserted into the opening in a locking manner. Thereafter a forward band <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> can be attached to tabs <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>A and <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>B as described above. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</cross-reference> illustrate another embodiment of a suspension <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> of the present invention in which the crown support section thereof comprises at least one section or portion that deforms when the protective headgear in which suspension <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> is used sustains an impact of a certain force. The energy absorbing section(s) are preferably areas of the crown support section of suspension <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> that react to force (for example, stress or strain) differently than the remainder of the crown support section. By deforming upon impact, the energy absorbing sections act to absorb the energy of the impact and also provide a readily visible indication that an impact has occurred. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> Upon application of a certain force (which can be calculated/controlled given the material properties and shape of the energy absorbing section), the energy absorbing section(s) preferably deform to a shape different than the original shape thereof. Preferably, the deformation is a permanent viscoelastic or plastic deformation of a molded polymeric suspension <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. Polymeric material having a modulus in the range of 5,000 to 20,000 psi (for example, certain polyethylenes) are preferably used in suspension <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. Upon experiencing a force sufficiently great to cause a given amount of deformation (including, for example, breakage), the deformation will be readily visible or apparent to the user. Upon viewing such a deformation, the user should immediately take the protective headgear out of service. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</cross-reference>, suspension <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> is attached to helmet <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> via tabs <highlight><bold>290</bold></highlight> that seat in ports <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> of helmet <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> as described above. Headband section <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> is preferably connected to crown straps <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight>A through <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight>D via connective members <highlight><bold>275</bold></highlight> such that little strain from a top impact with helmet <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is experienced by headband section <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>. Because most of the strain resulting from an impact on helmet <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is experienced in crown straps <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight>A through <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight>D of suspension <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, the &ldquo;energy absorbing&rdquo; section(s) are preferably located in crown straps <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight>A through <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight>D. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> In the embodiment of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</cross-reference>, the energy absorbing sections comprise bulges <highlight><bold>285</bold></highlight> and holes <highlight><bold>286</bold></highlight> in crown straps <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight>A through <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight>D. Bulges <highlight><bold>285</bold></highlight> and holes <highlight><bold>286</bold></highlight> create narrow, high-stress areas in crown straps <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight>A through <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight>D that deform sufficiently upon an impact of a substantial force to provide a readily visible indication to the user that such an impact has occurred. With commercially available protective helmets, on the other hand, the user may sustain a substantial impact that has compromised the integrity of the suspension and not be aware that the suspension is damaged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0043" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0043&rsqb;</number> Preferably, the energy adsorbing sections of suspension <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> are allowed to deform and/or break without substantially jeopardizing the integrity of suspension <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. In that regard, bulges <highlight><bold>285</bold></highlight> and holes <highlight><bold>286</bold></highlight> in crown straps <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight>A through <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight>D are preferably locate generally near the center portion of crown section <highlight><bold>240</bold></highlight>. A partial halo or ring <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight> is preferably provided on each side which connects crown strap <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight>A to <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight>D and crown strap <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight>C to <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight>D at a point radially outside (relative to center point C in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</cross-reference>) of bulges <highlight><bold>285</bold></highlight> in crown straps <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight>A through <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight>D. In this manner, crown straps <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight>A through <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight>D can break as a result of an impact in the area of bulges <highlight><bold>285</bold></highlight> without failure of suspension <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. In that regard, partial halo <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight> will remain connected to crown straps <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight>A through <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight>D and prevent the head of the user from contacting helmet <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> upon such an impact. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0044" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0044&rsqb;</number> The energy absorbing sections of the present invention can take numerous shapes and dimensions. The energy absorbing section(s) may comprise, for example, one or more generally central passages or holes. In general, the stresses experienced around the edges of a passage or hole are triple in a part under tension as would be experienced in a similar part without such a passage under the same tension. Preferably crown straps <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight>A through <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight>D have ridges along each outer edge to increase their strength. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0045" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0045&rsqb;</number> Headband section <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> of the suspension <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> preferably incorporates a forward band section <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight>. Forward band <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> preferably comprises a forward portion <highlight><bold>620</bold></highlight> and an upward portion <highlight><bold>630</bold></highlight>. During use, forward portion <highlight><bold>620</bold></highlight> is preferably incorporated into headband section <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> which has been connected together as described above in connection with forward band section <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>. Upon incorporation into headband section <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, upward portion <highlight><bold>630</bold></highlight> extends upward to be positioned between the crown of the user&apos;s head and crown support section <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> of suspension <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>. As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</cross-reference>, forward band <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> can be fabricated such that forward portion <highlight><bold>620</bold></highlight> and upward portion <highlight><bold>630</bold></highlight> are formed by creating a slit <highlight><bold>640</bold></highlight> in a piece of material to split forward band <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> into forward portion <highlight><bold>620</bold></highlight> and upward portion <highlight><bold>630</bold></highlight>. Forward band <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> can thus act to cushion the fit of the suspensions of the present invention on both the forehead and crown and the user. Forward band <highlight><bold>600</bold></highlight> is thus preferably fabricated from a material or materials as described in connection with forward band section <highlight><bold>500</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> Referring to the drawings, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> there is shown a toilet bowl <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> supported on a suitable base <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, to which flush water is supplied by a solenoid-operated valve V and from which effluent is discharged through a trap <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> into a treating chamber <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> where it is macerated by a macerator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>A and then pumped by means of a pump <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> through a discharge conductor <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to a soil pipe. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The toilet bowl <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is of generally conventional configuration, has at the top a cored passage <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> which, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, extends peripherally around the rear half of the bowl, through which flush water is delivered to the bowl for flushing, and a discharge opening <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> at the bottom through which effluent is discharged. The rear end of the cored passage is connected by a feeder tube <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> and suitable plumbing <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> to the valve V which, in turn, is connected to a water supply, not shown, so that operation of the valve will supply flush water to the cored passage. The forward ends of the cored passage terminate diametrically opposite each other approximately halfway between the front and rear ends of the bowl in openings <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> within which there are fixed spray nozzles <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> through which water delivered into the cored passage is ejected downwardly on the surface of the bowl. The nozzles <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> comprise, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>A, cylindrical plugs <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight> containing ports <highlight><bold>36</bold></highlight> which are in communication with the cored passage <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> and downwardly-open slots <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> designed to eject the flush water downwardly in fan shape against the surface of the bowl so as to wash the surface down. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> The trap <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> for conducting the effluent from the bowl to the treating chamber, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference>, has an upwardly-inclined leg <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight>, the lower end of which is flanged at <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> to fit over an extension <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> defining the opening <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight>, and a vertical leg <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> connected at its upper end to the inclined leg <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and at its lower end to the treating tank <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> As seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, the treating chamber <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is mounted on the supporting structure for the bowl behind the bowl, is of generally circular cross section, is closed at the bottom, and has an open top, peripherally of which there is a beveled rim <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. A cover plate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> having a beveled edge <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> is mounted on the rim <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> and detachably secured thereto by a locking band <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, the upper and lower edges <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> of which overlap the beveled portions of the rim and edge. The locking band <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> provides for easy removal of the cover plate from the treating chamber. The cover plate supports the macerator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, the pump <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the drive means therefor. To this end, the cover plate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is provided with a top opening <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> in which there is mounted a vertical bearing assembly <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> which supports a shaft <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> in a vertical position with a portion extending above the treating chamber and a portion extending into the treating chamber. The portion of the shaft <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> extending above the treating chamber is fixed by a coupling <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> to the drive shaft <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> of a motor M. The portion of the shaft <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> extending into <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> the treating chamber has fixed to it a macerator blade <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> disposed in a horizontal position at right angles to the axis of the shaft. Below the macerator blade, the bottom of the treating chamber is structured to provide an annular toroidal surface <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight>. The blade <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight> and the subjacent toroidal surface <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> provide for hydraulic attrition of effluent delivered into the treating chamber. The macerator operates by hydraulic attrition rather than cutting to disperse and particulate the solids in the effluent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The cover plate <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is also provided with an opening <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> for receiving the pump assembly <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the latter is mounted in the opening by means of a ring <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> fastened by bolts <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> to the top plate and comprises a sealed housing <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> within which there is a stator <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> and a rotor <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>. The upper end of the rotor is fixed to a shaft <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> journaled in a bearing <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight> mounted on the ring <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>. The stator and rotor <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> constitute, in conjunction, a worm pump. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> A pulley <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> is fixed to the upper end of the shaft <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, a pulley <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> is fixed to the upper end of the shaft <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>, and a belt <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> is trained about pulleys <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight> so that the motor M drives the macerator and the pump simultaneously. A control module <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight> is mounted at the back of a housing <highlight><bold>97</bold></highlight> of the toilet system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> The pump <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> has an intake port <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> within treating chamber <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and a discharge port <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> externally of the treating chamber. Discharge port <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> is connected by a coupling <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> to a length of pipe <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, as seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</cross-reference>, which is in turn connected by a coupling <highlight><bold>103</bold></highlight> to an inlet port <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> on discharge conductor <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> which, as previously mentioned, is connected to a waste pipe. The combination of discharge port <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>, pipe <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, and inlet port <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight> are coaxial such that discharge from pump <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> flows in a straight line to conductor <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, reducing the chance of blockage as effluent is discharged from pump <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. Thus, effluent flows from pump <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> in an improved manner through a conduit, free of bends along its length, to conductor <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, the conduit being formed, in a preferred embodiment, of discharge port <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>, pipe <highlight><bold>101</bold></highlight>, and inlet port <highlight><bold>105</bold></highlight>, connected to one another by couplings. This alleviates a problem encountered in prior art systems wherein effluent exiting the discharge pipe encountered a first 90&deg; elbow, flowed downwardly, and then encountered a second 90&deg; elbow before entering the conductor in horizontal fashion. When large amounts of waste and paper were flushed through such a configuration, the discharge force of the pump caused the waste and paper to impact the 90&deg; elbows and lead to plugging of the system. To clear such clogs is a difficult and time consuming process, and includes dismantling a major portion of the system. Consequently, the improved flow of effluent from the pump to conductor <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> of the present invention realizes a significant improvement in the operation and efficiency of the toilet system. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 5</cross-reference>, the discharge conductor <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is connected at one end directly to the vertical leg of the trap by means of a valve assembly <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight> comprising a beveled plate <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> which defines an opening <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>, a plate <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> which defines an opening <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> and a flexible valve member <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> positioned therebetween and clamped in place by a circumferential clamping ring <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight>. The plate <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> is fixed to a branch pipe <highlight><bold>119</bold></highlight> stemming from the leg <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, the axis of which is inclined upwardly with respect to the vertical axis of the leg <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> so that the plate <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> slopes downwardly at a diverging angle with respect to the axis of the vertical leg. The plate <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> is fixed to the discharge pipe <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> at an angle such as to be parallel to the plate <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight>. As thus constructed, the valve assembly slopes downwardly and divergently with respect to the axis of the vertical leg of the trap. The flexible valve member <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> is arranged to open inwardly with respect to the conductor <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> by a pressure head within the vertical leg of the trap and to close by gravity in the absence of a head in the vertical portion of the trap. Normally, when the pump is in operation, it produces a low pressure in the vertical portion of the trap so that the low pressure, in conjunction with the gravitational disposition of the valve member <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>, ensures that the valve will be held closed under normal conditions. An angular disposition of the valve is of importance to prevent siphoning of the effluent from the vertical leg of the trap when the system is at rest. When the system is in use and, for some reason, the pump becomes disabled, a pressure head developed in the vertical leg of the trap <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> will open the valve <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight> and allow the effluent to flow directly through the conductor <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> to the waste pipe. The pressure head can be provided by dumping water into the bowl or, if the valve V is operative, supplying water to the bowl through the valve. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> In prior toilet systems of this kind, diaphragm and gear pumps have been used for effecting discharge of effluent. However, in accordance with this invention, it has been found that a screw pump is considerably more satisfactory and effective insofar as the flush cycle is concerned. The stator <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> is comprised of flexible rubber and the rotor is plastic. In order to reduce the friction load of the plastic rotor in the flexible rubber stator, a portion of the worm at one end has been reduced to the root diameter of the worm. As herein illustrated, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>, the rotor <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>, which is comprised of Bakelite, is 4.28 inches axial length. The diameter of the worm is 1.12 inches and has a helix angle of 25 degrees with a lead of 1.648 and at one end a portion a 1.12 inches in length reduced to a uniform diameter of 0.0875 inches. By reducing the portion a at the one end to the root diameter of the worm, the friction between the rotor and stator can be materially reduced, thus reducing the power input necessary to drive the pump. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> A flushing cycle of the toilet system in normal operation is sequenced by the control circuitry of control module <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight> so that motor M is started first, simultaneously driving macerator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>A and discharge pump <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, followed by energization of a solenoid to open the valve V for supplying flush water to the bowl. In a preferred embodiment, the bowl is flushed with 2 and &frac12; quarts of water during the flushing cycle. While the valve is still open and flushing is still occurring, the discharge pump <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> stops. The flushing operation is subsequently stopped by closing of the valve V. Macerator <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>A is in operation during the entire time that discharge pump <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is in operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> is a wiring diagram showing a timer T which provides for sequencing the operation of the valve V and motor M during the flushing cycle, so as to start the motor before opening the valve and to stop the motor before closing the valve. In the circuit, there is shown a normally open switch SW for energizing the circuit, the motor M for driving the macerator and pump, a solenoid S for activating the valve V, and a timer T powered by a power source P and controlling the sequenced operation of motor M and solenoid actuated valve V. Timer T is preferably sealed in epoxy in module <highlight><bold>95</bold></highlight> to protect it from moisture, heat, and other environmental conditions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the timing of the sequence of the steps during the flushing cycle of the system is as follows. The total operation run time of the flushing cycle is eight seconds, and during that time, timer T of the control circuit performs three separate functions. At the start of the sequence, that is, time zero, the timer first energizes motor M, which then runs for the first five seconds of the cycle and is then deenergized. The timer also provides a delay of one and a half seconds from time zero, at which time the solenoid is opened, opening valve V to provide rinsing of toilet bowl <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The timer then provides for the solenoid and valve V to remain open until the end of the eight second run cycle. Such a combination of timing sequences has been found to be particularly advantageous. The particular timing of the components of the toilet system described herein utilizes a minimum of water to efficiently evacuate and rinse the bowl, as well as efficiently treat and discharge the waste from the toilet system. Closing the normally open switch SW during the flushing cycle preferably does not affect operation of the either of the delay cycles, that is, the first delay of 1 &frac12; seconds before the solenoid and valve open, or the second delay of 6 &frac12; seconds during which the valve remains open and the bowl is flushed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, timer T is calibrated to an accuracy of &plusmn;2%. Motor M preferably is a &frac14; BP motor with a 20 amp in-rush, 10 amp run capacity, and in-rush time of approximately 1 second. Solenoid S preferably has a 2 amp in-rush, a 0.45 amp run capacity, and an in-rush time of approximately 0.2 seconds. The supply voltage from power source P to timer T is preferably unfiltered 115 V.A.C. at 60 Hz, with a voltage variation of &plusmn;10%, with transients not to exceed 400 volts for 1 milli-second. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> It is to be appreciated that although timer T is shown here in conjunction with a specific configuration of a water saving toilet, other constructions of toilets appropriate for the use of such a timer having the performance characteristics described herein are considered within the scope of the invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> In a preferred embodiment, the power to motor M is supplied initially to the starting circuit of the motor, preferably for approximately 400-600 milliseconds, more preferably approximately 500 milliseconds, and then the power is switched to the running circuit of motor M for the remainder of the five second period during which motor M runs. By switching power from the starting circuit to the running circuit in this manner, the expense of a separate starting switch in the motor is eliminated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> In light of the foregoing disclosure of the invention and description of the preferred embodiments, those skilled in this area of technology will readily understand that various modifications and adaptations can be made without departing from the scope and spirit of the invention. All such modifications and adaptations are intended to be covered by the following claims. </paragraph>

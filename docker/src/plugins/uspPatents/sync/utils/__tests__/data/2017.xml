<?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a mobile soil working device as defined in the precharacterizing part of claim <b>1</b>, as well as to a method for working soil as defined in the precharacterizing part of claim <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Soil working devices are known from prior art which comprise at least one machine frame, a drive and at least one support arm adapted to be moved up and down by the drive and pivotably supported at the machine frame. The soil working devices further comprise at least one insertion tool adapted to be pivoted about a first pivot axis relative to the support arm and to be moved upward and downward by means of the support arm, the insertion tool being adapted to be inserted into the soil and be pulled out from the same. Prior to insertion into the soil, the insertion tool is in a initial position under a predetermined insertion angle and, due to the movement of the machine frame in the traveling direction, performs a pivot movement in the soil about a first pivot axis in the direction of a first pivoting direction, the pivot movement superposing the upward and downward movement. Further, the soil working device comprises at least one returning means that is coupled to the insertion tool at a first end and is coupled to the returning means at the second end, wherein the returning means, after the insertion tool has left the soil, returns the insertion tool to the initial position by pivoting the insertion tool in a second pivoting direction opposite to the first pivoting direction.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">From European Patent Publication EP-A-0037595 a soil working device is known that has two carrying arms guided in a parallelogram-like manner and pivotably supporting a tool holder at one end, while the other end of the arms is pivotably supported at a machine frame. A pushrod of a crank drive is hinged to the tool holder and drives the same so that it performs an up and down movement. One of the two support arms is variable in length and comprises a stop spring means. As soon as the insertion tool is outside the soil, the support arm is pulled to the stop by the spring force. With the insertion tool inserted and the soil working device moving forward, the tool with the tool holder pivots against the traveling direction and the length-variable support arm is extended against the spring force.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, the previously known soil working devices have the drawback that the insertion tools may be damaged when they hit a hard object in the soil, such as a stone, for example. Further, there is a need for the manufacture of machines that are as light-weight as possible.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Therefore, it is an object of the present invention to provide a soil working device and a method for working a soil surface, in which the soil working device is protected against damage when the at least one insertion tool hits a hard object in the soil, wherein the soil working device can be manufactured in a simple and economic manner.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The object is achieved with the features of claims <b>1</b> and <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The invention advantageously provides that the returning means comprises a spring means in addition to the returning element, the spring means allowing the insertion tool to be pivoted in the second pivoting direction beyond the initial position so that, when hitting a hard object in the soil, the insertion tool can be pivoted beyond the initial position by pivoting the insertion tool in the second pivoting direction.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">This is advantageous in that the insertion tool can evade the hard object in the soil also in the second pivoting direction, although the insertion tool already is in the initial position. In this manner it can be prevented that the insertion tools are damaged. Due to the fact that the spring means which allows the insertion tool to be pivoted beyond the initial position in the second pivoting direction, is arranged in the returning means, previously used soil working devices can easily be retrofitted by replacing the previously used returning means by the returning means of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Further, the soil working device of the present invention becomes only slightly heavier than a previously known soil processing device.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">When being pivoted beyond the initial position in the second pivoting direction, the insertion tool may be pivotable against the spring force of the spring means.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">This has the advantage that, as soon as the obstacle in the soil has been overcome and the insertion tool leaves the soil again, the insertion tool is pivoted into the initial position by the spring force of the spring means. In this way, the operation of the soil working device does not have to be interrupted when an insertion tool hits a hard object.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The spring force of the spring means may be chosen such that the spring means allows the insertion tool to be moved beyond the initial position only when a force is exerted on the insertion tool that exceeds a predetermined force.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Thus, the spring means is not actuated during normal operation. Only when the insertion toll hits a hard object in the soil and the insertion tool already is in the initial position, can the insertion tool pivot farther in the second pivoting direction beyond the initial position and thereby actuate the spring means.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The spring force of the spring means may be adjustable. For example, another spring may be chosen or the spring may be pre-tensioned differently.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The returning means may have a stop that limits the pivotal movement of the insertion means in the second pivoting direction when the initial position is reached or during normal operation.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The returning element may be a spring, preferably a compression spring.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The returning means may be a piston-cylinder unit. This piston-cylinder unit may be telescopable.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The returning means designed as a piston-cylinder unit may extend substantially in parallel with the support arm. In this manner, the returning means designed as a piston-cylinder unit and the support arm form a sort of parallelogram.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The spring means may be a compression spring.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The returning means may be coupled to the machine frame via an adjustment means, wherein the adjustment means allows the adjustment of the insertion angle in the initial position of the insertion tool.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">At least one tool holder may be provided for the at least one insertion tool, which tool holder is supported in the support arm for pivotal movement about the first pivot axis, the support arm being adapted to be moved up and down by the drive.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">A plurality of insertion tools may be mounted to the tool holder.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">A plurality of tool holders may be arranged side by side, each having a plurality of insertion tools fastened thereto, wherein a respective returning means is provided per tool holder and is connected with the respective tool holder.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">According to the present invention a method for working soil may further be provided, the method comprising the following steps:
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0025">pulling or driving a soil working device over a soil surface,</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0026">inserting at least one insertion tool, coupled to a machine frame, into the soil and pulling it out of the soil,</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0027">wherein, prior to insertion, the insertion tool is in an initial position under a predetermined insertion angle and, due to the movement of the machine frame in the traveling direction, performs a pivot movement in the soil about a first pivot axis in the direction of a first pivoting direction, the pivot movement superposing the upward and downward movement,</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0028">wherein the insertion tool, after having left the soil, is returned to the initial position by at least one returning element arranged in at least one returning means, by pivoting the insertion tool in a second pivoting direction opposite to the first pivoting direction, wherein the returning means is coupled to the machine frame at a first end and is coupled to the insertion tool at a second end.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0029">In such a method it is advantageously provided that a spring means arranged in the returning means allows a pivoting of the insertion tool beyond the initial position in the second pivoting direction, when the tool hits a hard object in the soil.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0030">When being pivoted beyond the initial position in the second pivoting direction, the insertion tool may be pivoted against the spring force of the spring means. The insertion tool may be pivoted beyond the initial position when a force is exerted on the insertion tool that exceeds a predetermined force.</p>

<p id="p-0038" num="0041">The soil working device <b>1</b> comprises the machine frame <b>20</b>. The soil working device <b>1</b> further comprises a drive <b>6</b> as well as at least one support arm <b>10</b> pivotably supported at the machine frame <b>20</b> and adapted to be moved up and down by the drive <b>6</b>. The support arm <b>10</b> can be driven by the drive <b>6</b> via a pushrod <b>8</b>. At a first end, the support arm <b>10</b> is supported at the machine frame <b>20</b> for pivotal movement about a pivot axis <b>42</b>. The pushrod <b>8</b> is connected with the support arm <b>10</b> via a hinge <b>44</b>. The In the embodiment illustrated the drive <b>6</b> is a crank drive. The drive <b>6</b> drives the pushrod <b>8</b> which in turn drives the support arm <b>10</b> so that the same is moved up and down and pivots about the pivot axis <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0042">At the second end of the support arm <b>10</b>, a tool holder <b>26</b> is fastened for pivotal movement about a first pivot axis <b>24</b>.

<p id="p-0042" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates an operating state in which the insertion tool <b>28</b> is in a state just prior to insertion into the soil. Prior to insertion into the soil, the insertion tool <b>28</b> is in an initial position under a predetermined insertion angle &#x3b1;. When the support arm <b>10</b> is pivoted down by the drive <b>6</b>, the insertion tool <b>28</b> is inserted into the soil. This state is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Due to the movement of the machine frame <b>20</b> in the traveling direction A, the insertion tool <b>28</b> performs a pivot movement in the soil <b>2</b> about a first pivot axis <b>24</b> in a first pivoting direction <b>42</b>, the pivot movement superposing the upward and downward movement.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates the state in which the insertion tool has been pivoted in the first pivoting direction <b>42</b> and has been moved upward again by the drive <b>6</b>.</p>

Thus, the piston rod <b>32</b> is extracted from the inner cylinder <b>35</b> and thus from the piston-cylinder unit <b>34</b> against the spring force of the returning element <b>54</b>, whereby the insertion tool <b>28</b> is allowed to pivot in the first pivoting direction <b>42</b> as the device travels on in the traveling direction A.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0053">As soon as the insertion tool <b>28</b> is pulled from the soil in normal operation, the piston rod <b>32</b> is inserted back into the cylinder unit <b>34</b> and thus into the inner cylinder <b>35</b> by the spring force of the returning element <b>54</b>, resulting in the insertion tool <b>28</b> pivoting in the second pivoting direction <b>43</b> about the pivot axis <b>24</b> back into the initial position. When reaching the initial position, the free end <b>32</b><i>a </i>of the piston rod <b>32</b> hits the stop element <b>58</b> and the movement of the piston rod <b>32</b> is limited.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0054">The spring means <b>52</b> is coupled to the inner cylinder <b>35</b>. The spring means <b>52</b> is biased with a defined pre-tensioning force. Only when a predetermined force acts on the insertion tool <b>28</b> and the insertion tool pivots in the direction of the second pivot axis <b>42</b> and the piston rod abuts against the stop <b>58</b>, is the spring means <b>52</b> compressed. This means that the spring force of the spring means <b>52</b> is selected such that the spring means <b>52</b> allows the insertion tool <b>28</b> to move beyond the initial position only when a force is exerted on the insertion tool <b>28</b> that exceeds a predetermined force. The pre-tensioning force and thus the spring force of the spring means may be adjustable. When the insertion tool <b>28</b> hits a hard object, the piston rod <b>32</b> can be moved farther into the cylinder unit <b>34</b> against the spring force of the spring means <b>52</b>, wherein the inner cylinder <b>35</b> is moved in the second pivoting direction <b>43</b> in the outer cylinder <b>33</b>. Here, the protrusion <b>59</b> of the inner cylinder <b>35</b> presses against the spring <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0055">The returning element <b>54</b> and the spring means <b>52</b> thus act on the insertion tool <b>28</b> in different directions. The returning element <b>54</b> causes the insertion tool <b>28</b> to move in the second pivoting direction <b>43</b> towards the initial position after pivoting in the soil and leaving the soil. After the insertion tool has pivoted in the second pivoting direction <b>43</b> beyond the initial position due to hitting a hard object in the soil, the spring means <b>52</b> causes the insertion tool <b>28</b> to move back n the first pivoting direction <b>42</b> as soon as the insertion tool <b>28</b> has left the soil <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0056">In the embodiment illustrated only one insertion tool and one tool holder are illustrated at one support arm with an associated returning means, respectively. However, in a soil working device, a plurality of support arms may be arranged side by side, each connected with a tool holder, wherein each tool holder has a returning means associated therewith. One or a plurality of insertion tools may be connected with each tool holder, respectively. The present invention has the advantage that, if only one insertion tool of a tool holder hits a hard object, only the insertion tools associated with this tool holder evade the object due to the spring means in the returning means. The other insertion tools on the other tool holders can be operated normally.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0057">Further, the embodiment illustrated shows an adjustment means <b>18</b> which can be pivoted with respect to the machine frame <b>20</b>. In this manner the pivot axis <b>16</b> can be pivoted relative to the machine frame <b>20</b>, whereby the returning means <b>12</b> and thus the tool holder <b>26</b> and the insertion tools <b>28</b> can be adjusted. Thus, the insertion angle &#x3b1; can be set in the initial position. The adjustment means <b>18</b> can be adjusted centrally for all units arranged side by side formed by a tool holder, insertion tools and returning means at the same time. As an alternative, the returning means may also be directly connected with the machine frame in a pivotable manner.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present description relates to agricultural equipment. More specifically, the present description relates to deployment of soil characteristic sensors, and other sensors, on ground-engaging portions of the agricultural equipment.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">There are a wide variety of different types of agricultural seeding or planting machines. They can include row crop planters, grain drills, air seeders, or the like. These machines place seeds at a desired depth within a plurality of parallel seed trenches that are formed in the soil. Thus, such systems have mechanisms that open a trench in the soil, drop seeds into the soil, and close the soil.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In addition, such machinery may also have mechanisms for dispersing fertilizer, or other chemicals, adjacent the seeds. The fertilizer, or other chemical, is often dispersed slightly below the seeds, within the soil, or off to one or both sides of the seed. Thus, there are a variety of different types of mechanisms that come into engagement with the soil.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The discussion above is merely provided for general background information and is not intended to be used as an aid in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A soil characteristic sensor is mounted on a soil engaging element of a planting machine. It can be mounted, for instance, on an element that engages the soil before a trench is opened, or after a trench is opened, but before it is closed. It can also be mounted on an element that engages the soil in a region of the soil trench, but after the trench is closed. It can be mounted on a scraping element that scrapes a disc, and it can be mounted on wedges or other items that run through the soil, and are carried by shanks.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">There are a wide variety of different types of seeding or planting machines. They can each use different ground engaging elements in order to engage the ground to open a trench in which seeds are placed, and then to close the trench on top of the seeds. In addition, these types of machines can also include soil engaging mechanisms for dispersing fertilizer or other chemicals in close proximity to the seed trench.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a top view of one example of an agricultural seeding machine <b>100</b>. Seeding machine <b>100</b> illustratively includes a toolbar <b>102</b> that is part of a frame <b>104</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> also shows that a plurality of planting row units <b>106</b> are mounted to the toolbar. Machine <b>100</b> can be towed behind another machine, such as a tractor.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a side view showing one example of a row unit <b>106</b> in more detail. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows that each row unit <b>106</b> illustratively has a frame <b>108</b>. Frame <b>108</b> is illustratively connected to toolbar <b>102</b> by a linkage shown generally at <b>110</b>. Linkage <b>110</b> is illustratively mounted to toolbar <b>102</b> so that it can move upwardly and downwardly (relative to toolbar <b>102</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, row unit <b>106</b> has its own seed hopper <b>112</b> that stores seed. The seed is provided from hopper <b>112</b> to a seed metering system <b>114</b> that meters the seed and provides the metered seed to a seed delivery system <b>116</b> that delivers the seed from the metering system <b>114</b> to the furrow or trench generated by the row unit. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> also shows that row unit <b>106</b> can have one or more ground engaging sensor support members or probes <b>125</b> and <b>127</b>. Members <b>125</b> and <b>127</b> can carry a variety of different types of sensors, such as electrodes, which form capacitive sensors, or other sensors. The sensors can be used to sense a wide variety of different types of soil characteristics.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">For instance, in one example, the sensor measurement taken by sensors carried by members <b>125</b> and <b>127</b> can be used to sense complex impedance, simple capacitance, or various other soil characteristics. The sensor signals can be processed, for instance, to obtain a measure of the soil characteristics, such as soil moisture, soil compaction, soil temperature, seed depth, soil fertility, and soil type, among others.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> also shows that, in one example, row unit <b>106</b> illustratively includes a row cleaner <b>118</b>, a furrow opener <b>120</b>, a set of gauge wheels <b>122</b>, and a set of closing wheels <b>124</b>. It can also include an additional hopper <b>126</b> that can be used to provide additional material, such as fertilizer or another chemical.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In operation, as row unit <b>106</b> moves in the direction generally indicated by arrow <b>128</b>, row cleaner <b>118</b> generally cleans the row and opener <b>120</b>, which is shown as a double disc opener, opens a furrow or trench in the row. Gauge wheels <b>122</b> illustratively control a depth of the furrow, and seed is metered by metering system <b>114</b> and delivered to the furrow by seed delivery system <b>116</b>. Members <b>125</b> and <b>127</b> can be spring biased into engagement with the soil, or rigidly attached to frame <b>108</b>. Thus, member <b>125</b> contacts the soil in an area within or closely proximate the trench, immediately after the trench is opened, but before the seed is placed therein. Member <b>125</b> can contact the side of the trench, the bottom of the trench, an area adjacent the trench, or other areas, and it is positioned so that it senses the desired characteristic shortly before the seed is placed in the furrow, or trench. In one example, member <b>127</b> also engages the soil within, or closely proximate the trench. It senses the desired characteristic shortly after the seed is placed in the furrow but before the trench is closed. Closing wheels <b>124</b> close the trench over the seed. A downforce actuator <b>131</b> can also be provided to controllably exert downforce to keep the row unit in desired engagement with the soil.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">It will also be noted that, while <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows one example of seed metering system <b>114</b> having a rotatable element, other types of seed metering systems could be used as well. In addition, while <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows that seed delivery system <b>116</b> is an assistive type of system, that actively captures the seed from the seed meter and physically moves the seed toward a lower opening where the seed exists into the trench, it could be any of a variety of other types of systems as well. For instance, one seed delivery system is a gravity drop system that includes a seed tube, that has an inlet position below the seed metering system. Metered seeds from the seed metering system <b>114</b> are dropped into the tube and fall (via gravitational force) through the seed tube into the seed trench. Other seed delivery systems may employ pneumatic pressure to convey the seed through a tube from the meter to the trench. All of these, and other types, of seed metering systems <b>114</b> and seed delivery systems <b>116</b> are contemplated herein.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref> show a more detailed view of a portion of the row unit <b>106</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, with one of gauge wheels <b>122</b> and openers <b>120</b> removed. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref> are now described in conjunction with one another. Sensor support member <b>125</b> can carry one or more sensors, or an array of more than two sensors. The sensors are generally indicated by <b>150</b>. Element <b>125</b> is biased into contact with the soil by a bias member, or spring <b>152</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The sensors in sensor array <b>150</b> are illustratively in electrical contact with a sensor processing system (such as the system described in greater detail below with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>) using any of a wide variety of different connection mechanisms. For instance, one or more electrical conductors corresponding to each of the sensors in sensor array <b>150</b> can be printed on (or within) element <b>125</b> and run along bias member <b>152</b>, upwardly on row unit <b>106</b>, where they electrically attach to a harness or harness assembly (not shown) which is routed to the system illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> (such as over a CAN bus or another link). Alternatively, the electrical conductor can make electrical contact with a communication system that communicates wirelessly with the system illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. These are only two examples of how electrical contact can be made with the sensors in sensor array <b>150</b>, and others can be used as well.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref> also show another example in which sensor support member <b>127</b> carries one or more sensors or a set of sensors in a sensor array. The sensors are shown generally at <b>154</b>. Further, the one or more sensors or sensor array <b>156</b> can, instead, or in addition, be disposed on the lower surface of sensor support member <b>127</b>. Therefore, the sensors <b>154</b> can be disposed to engage (and sense a characteristics of) soil on the side of member <b>127</b>, as it moves through the soil and the sensors <b>156</b> can be disposed to engage (and sense characteristics of) soil below member <b>127</b>, as it moves through the soil. In one example, member <b>127</b> can be mounted so that it is slightly offset in a direction transverse to the direction of travel of row unit <b>106</b>, from the center of the seed trench (where the seed strip is placed).</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The sensed characteristics can be used to control controllable subsystems on the row unit (such as downforce, closing wheel downforce, gauge wheel settings, etc.), on the entire planting machine, or on the towing vehicle. Some examples are described in more detail below. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref> show yet another example of row unit <b>106</b>. Some elements are similar to those shown in the previous figures, and therefore they are similarly numbered. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref> will now be described in conjunction with one another.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref> show an additional sensor support member <b>160</b>. Member <b>160</b> illustratively includes a bias member <b>162</b> and a sensor carrying portion <b>164</b>. Bias member <b>162</b> illusively biases a lower surface <b>166</b> of sensor carrying portion <b>164</b> into engagement with the ground, after the trench is closed by closing wheels <b>124</b>. The lower surface <b>166</b> illustratively has one or more sensors that can be arranged in different configurations to form a single sensor, one or more pairs of sensors, or one or more sensor arrays.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows a set of longitudinally arranged sensors <b>170</b> and a set of transversely arranged sensors <b>168</b>. These arrangements are shown by way of example only, and other arrangements can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Again, the sensors can be a wide variety of different types of sensors, such as electrodes, protruding probes (which protrude from surface <b>166</b>), mechanical resilience sensors (which can, for instance, be used to sense soil compaction characteristics), or a wide variety of other sensors. They can be electrically connected to a signal processing system (such as that described below with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>) in a wide variety of different ways. As discussed above, one or more conductors can be formed on or within portion <b>164</b> and portion <b>162</b> and can extend up to frame portion <b>108</b>. There, they can either be electrically connected to a cable harness, which can be used to transmit information to the signal processing system (such as over a CAN bus or otherwise), or they can be connected to a wireless communication system which can be used to communicate the information to the signal processing system using a wireless communication mechanism, such as a near field communication mechanism or a cellular communication mechanism, among others.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">It will also be noted that a sensor supporting member <b>160</b> can be mounted forward of opener <b>120</b>. The sensors can thus sense the characteristics of the soil prior to opening the trench. As discussed below, characteristics such as soil compaction, moisture, residue, etc., when sensed before opener <b>120</b> arrives, can be used to control controllable systems (such as downforce actuator <b>131</b>) for better performance.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows yet another example of an opener assembly <b>200</b>. Opener assembly <b>200</b> illustratively has a frame <b>202</b> that supports a single disc opener <b>204</b> and a gauge wheel <b>206</b>. In the example shown, opener <b>204</b> can open a trench in the soil for fertilizer, or seed, or for another chemical, etc. Opener assembly <b>200</b> also illustratively includes a scraper <b>208</b>. Scraper <b>208</b> is mounted adjacent opener <b>204</b> so that it removes soil that adheres to opener <b>204</b>, while opener <b>204</b> is opening a trench. Scraper <b>208</b> is shown with a set of sensors that form sensor array <b>210</b>. Because scraper <b>210</b> is disposed closely proximate opener <b>204</b>, at its lower end, sensor array <b>210</b> may illustratively be disposed, at least partially, within the trench that is opened by opener wheel <b>204</b>. Therefore, it can measure soil characteristics, such as trench depth. In addition, it may also be disposed to come into contact with a side of the trench, or with the soil, in other ways. Therefore, it can sense other characteristics of the soil as well.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">As with the other sensor arrays described with respect to the other figures, the sensors in sensor array <b>210</b> can be electrically connected to a system (such as that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>) using electrical conductors that are formed on or within scraper <b>208</b>, using electrical wires, or using other electrical contact mechanisms. The scraper <b>208</b> can be provided with only a single sensor or a pair of sensors as well, instead of an array.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8-10</figref> show another example of a row unit <b>220</b>. Row unit <b>220</b> can be used to open a trench in the soil, and deposit seeds and fertilizer (or other chemicals) for instance, in the trench. In one example, row unit <b>220</b> is used on an air drill. An air drill can be configured to receive seed and fertilizer (or other chemical) from an air cart that is towed behind, or in front of, the air drill, itself.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, row unit <b>220</b> illustratively includes a structural frame <b>222</b> that supports a set of depending shanks <b>224</b> and <b>226</b>. Shank <b>224</b> has a wedge or boot <b>234</b> that is illustratively disposed to engage the soil more deeply than a wedge or boot <b>242</b> carried by shank <b>226</b>. Boot <b>234</b> includes a fertilizer delivery tube <b>228</b> that has an inlet end <b>230</b> that can be connected to a hose, or other conduit, and that receives fertilizer. Fertilizer tube <b>228</b> also has an outlet end <b>232</b> where the fertilizer exits. Shank <b>224</b> has the wedge or boot <b>234</b>, at its distal end. Wedge <b>234</b> has a ground engaging tip <b>236</b> that engages the soil and forms a trench that receives fertilizer from the outlet end <b>232</b> of fertilizer tube <b>228</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Shank <b>226</b> includes a seed tube <b>238</b> that has an inlet end <b>240</b> and an outlet end that terminates within a seed depositing portion of wedge <b>242</b>. The seed exits wedge <b>242</b> at opening <b>244</b>. Wedge <b>242</b> illustratively has a front tip portion <b>246</b> and a sweep portion <b>248</b>. Tip portion <b>246</b> opens a seed trench in the soil, and sweep portion <b>248</b> causes the soil to move upwardly, over the seed exit opening <b>244</b>, as wedge <b>242</b> moves through the soil.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> specifically shows that, in one example, wedge <b>234</b> is disposed to engage the soil more deeply than wedge <b>242</b>. It can also be offset to one side or the other so that the fertilizer is laid down in a strip within the soil that is adjacent to, and slightly below, the strip of seeds that is laid down in the soil by wedge <b>242</b>. Row unit <b>220</b> also illustratively includes one or more closing wheels <b>250</b> that close the trench and firm the soil so that both the seeds and fertilizer are covered with soil.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> shows that, in one example, one or more sensors <b>252</b> can be used for form a single sensor, a sensor pair or a sensor array on the fertilizer opener. Alternatively, or in addition, another set of sensors <b>254</b> can be disposed to form a different single sensor, sensor pair or sensor array on the fertilizer opener. Sensors <b>252</b> will engage the soil on the bottom of the fertilizer trench, while sensors <b>254</b> illustratively engage the soil on the sides of that trench. Therefore, the sensor arrays formed by sensors <b>252</b> and <b>254</b> can be used to sense a wide variety of different types of soil characteristics, such as those discussed above.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> also shows that, in one example, wedge <b>242</b> illustratively has one or more sensors <b>256</b> that form a single sensor, one sensor pair or sensor array on wedge <b>242</b>. It can include another set of sensors <b>258</b> that form another single sensor, sensor pair or sensor array on wedge <b>242</b>. Again, because sensors <b>256</b> are disposed to engage the soil on the bottom of the seed trench, and sensors <b>258</b> are disposed to engage soil on the side of that trench, they can be configured to sense the same, or different, soil characteristics.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">A number of examples of how the various sensors can be used will now be described. They are described for the sake of example only. Some of the sensor arrays (where there are more than two sensors or electrodes in a cluster) can provide more information than a sensor that simply has one or two electrodes. For instance, in places where the array is oriented vertically relative to the ground, adjacent pairs of electrodes can be used to sense the different levels of moisture at the different soil depths associated with each electrode pair. The array can also detect where the surface of the soil is with respect to the opener (which leads to an indication of the depth of the seed trench and hence seed depth). Such an arrangement can also indicate how much residue there may be on top of the soil. This is because the measured characteristics of the soil will differ from the measured characteristics of the residue.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The vertically arranged sensors can be arranged so that one of the sensors (or electrodes) is an emitter electrode and the others are receiver electrodes that are vertically spaced at different distances from the emitter electrode. Therefore, the different sensor pairs can sense characteristics which are indicative of soil compaction or other characteristics. Because the emitter will have different spacing from the receivers in the array, soil compaction proximate the sensor (e.g., the sidewall compaction) can be sensed relative to compaction further away from the sensor (e.g., un-altered soil compaction). This is because the distance of penetration of the capacitive fringing effect into the surrounding soil is proportional to the distance between the electrodes. Therefore, an electrode pair (e.g., the emitter electrode and one sensing electrode) where the electrodes are spaced further apart from one another will be sensing the effects on the capacitive fringing effect from soil that is further from the electrode pair, than an electrode pair where the electrodes are spaced closer together. While soil compaction has been discussed, the same is true of other soil characteristics.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In places where the sensor array is arranged generally horizontally relative to the surface of the ground, one of the electrodes may be arranged as an emitter that emits an electrical signal, while the others are configured as receivers. In this arrangement, the receiving electrodes are at different distances from the emitter electrode. Thus, various pairs of electrodes can sense moisture and compaction (or other characteristics) at different depths and soil volumes relative to the sensor platform. This can be measured because the depth of penetration of the capacitive fringing effect (which is measured by a given electrode pair) is proportional to the distance between the electrodes.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">It will also be noted that, while the present discussion has proceeded with respect to the sensors being disposed on ground engaging portions of a planting machine, they could be disposed on other agricultural equipment as well. For instance, they can be used on tillage or fertilizer equipment where no seeding elements are present.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">By way of example, the ground engaging elements of the tillage implement can be rippers or sweeps of various sizes, which are similar to the shanks discussed above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8-10</figref>, without the seeding equipment. The tillage implement may also have a vertical tillage or deep tillage disk or plow share which can have a scraper, similar to that shown above in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. A fertilizer tool (which does not plant any seed) can be equipped with a tyne-style opener and/or a rolling blade opener (similar to that shown above in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>). These types of implements and tools may also have closers, although they may not as well.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is a block diagram of one example of a control system architecture <b>300</b> that can be used with the sensors described above. Architecture <b>300</b> illustratively includes machine control and monitoring system <b>102</b> that receives sensor signal inputs from one or more soil characteristic sensors <b>304</b>-<b>306</b>, and it can also receive a sensor signal input from a variety of other sensors <b>308</b>. The sensor signals can be from any of the sensors described above.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">System <b>302</b> also generates control signals for controlling controllable subsystems <b>310</b>. The controllable subsystems <b>310</b> can be on the implements that carry the sensors (such as pneumatic systems, hydraulic systems, electric systems, etc.), or they can be on other machines (such as tractors that tow the implements, or other machines).

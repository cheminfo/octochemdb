<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present description generally relates to hydraulic implements, or other hydraulic work machines, that are driven or powered by a hydraulic system associated with a support machine. More specifically, but not by limitation, the present description relates to a fluid recovery system for a hydraulic implement.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">There are many different types of implements that are hydraulically-powered by a support vehicle or other support machine. Further, implements are utilized in a variety of different types of applications. For example, in an agricultural application, an agricultural implement can include tools for operations such as tillage, planting, spraying, baling, to name a few. In a turf management application, a turf management implement can comprise a mower, sod cutter, sprayer, planter, etc. Further, in construction and/or forestry applications, the implements can include hydraulic arms, loaders, buckets, grapples, among others.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Such implements are typically attachable/detachable from the support machine, such as a tractor or other mobile machine. In this way, the support machine can be equipped for any of a variety of different types of implements, depending on the particular application needs. The support machine and implement include corresponding hydraulic couplers that allow the implement to be quickly and easily connected/disconnected from a hydraulic system associated with the mobile machine that provides a supply of hydraulic fluid under pressure, that is utilized by the implement for actuating (driving, deploying, etc.) its components.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Further, an implement can be carried by the support machine in a variety of ways. For instance, the support machine can be configured to tow the implement. In another example, the implement can be mounted on the support machine, such as mounted on a front of an agricultural tractor.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">As briefly mentioned above, there are a wide variety of different types of hydraulically powered implements (or other work machines) that are removably couplable to a support machine and configured to receive a supply of hydraulic fluid (e.g., hydraulic oil) under pressure from a hydraulic system on the support machine.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Typically, the support machine has a supply line from a hydraulic fluid pump and a supply line coupler configured to receive a corresponding supply line coupler on the implement. These couplers can be any of a wide variety of different coupler types, such as, but not limited to, flush-face couplers, spin-on couplers, lock-ring couplers, or other types of quick connect/disconnect couplers. The couplers on the support machine and the implement comprise corresponding valves (or other flow control mechanisms) that are mechanically opened when the couplers are coupled to one another to allow fluid flow to the implement, and closed when they decoupled to prevent fluid flow.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Similarly, the support machine and implement include one or more corresponding return lines, that are configured to return hydraulic fluid to the support machine. These return line(s) also have corresponding couplers, with associated flow control mechanisms, such as the examples mentioned above. In some instances, a number of return lines can be utilized. For instance, a first return line returns hydraulic fluid to a supply tank or reservoir on the support machine, from which the support machine pumps the hydraulic fluid through the supply line. Additionally, separate return lines can provide a return flow of hydraulic fluid through sensing circuitry and/or directly to the fluid pump to be pumped back to the implement. These, of course, are by way of example only.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">When not in use, the implement is decoupled from the support machine by detaching any mechanical connections, such as a hitch or other linkage, and disconnecting the hydraulic fluid and/or electrical connections. The implement is then stored until later use. In many cases, implements are stored outdoors or in other environments that can cause the fluid pressure in the implement's hydraulic circuitry to increase due to thermal expansion, or other causes. This increase in the internal fluid pressure can cause a number of problems. For instance, the increased pressure can cause spontaneous actuation of components on the implement (e.g., deployment of hydraulic arms, etc.). Alternatively, or in addition, the increased pressure can cause valves, seals, hoses, or other hydraulic circuitry components to fail and/or other structural components on the implement to bend or deform. This, of course, can cause damage to the implement and/or the surrounding environment, and is undesirable.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">One way to mitigate some of the above problems is to provide pressure release coupler(s) on the hydraulic lines of the implement. The pressure release coupler(s) are configured to release some of the fluid pressure when the internal pressure of the hydraulic circuitry reaches a threshold. However, this results in the hydraulic fluid being expelled into the surrounding environment, such as onto the ground, which results in a waste of the hydraulic fluid and can raises environmental or other concerns.</p>

<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Agricultural implement <b>102</b> includes hydraulic fluid recovery system <b>128</b>, and can include other functionality <b>129</b> as well. Hydraulic fluid recovery system <b>128</b> is configured to recover hydraulic fluid in implement <b>192</b>, by capturing and storing the hydraulic fluid when implement <b>102</b> is disconnected from hydraulic system <b>116</b>.

<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a block diagram of one example of hydraulic systems <b>116</b> and <b>124</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>. As illustrated, hydraulic system <b>116</b> includes a set of connectors <b>200</b> (e.g., couplers <b>156</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>), and hydraulic system <b>124</b> includes a corresponding set of connectors <b>202</b>, which are configured to releasably couple to the set of connectors <b>200</b>. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, set <b>200</b> includes connectors <b>204</b>, <b>212</b>, <b>218</b>, and <b>224</b>, and set <b>202</b> includes connectors <b>206</b>, <b>214</b>, <b>220</b>, <b>226</b>, which are discussed in further detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Each connector in sets <b>200</b> and <b>202</b> includes a respective flow control mechanism configured to allow fluid flow through the respective connector when coupled, and prevent fluid flow when decoupled. In one example, the connectors <b>200</b> and <b>202</b> comprise respective sets of quick connect/disconnect couplers, each having a flow control mechanism that is mechanically opened through physical coupling of the connectors, and closed when the couplers are disconnected. Each fluid line is formed by one or more conduits (formed of any suitable material) that convey the hydraulic fluid through the hydraulic circuitry.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">As illustrated, hydraulic system <b>116</b> includes supply line connector <b>204</b> configured to receive corresponding supply line connector <b>206</b> of hydraulic system <b>124</b>. When connected, the fluid control mechanisms associated with connectors <b>204</b> and <b>206</b> are opened, thereby providing a hydraulic fluid under pressure though supply line <b>208</b> to one or more hydraulically-powered components <b>126</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Hydraulic systems <b>116</b> and <b>124</b> also include at least one hydraulic fluid return line or configured to provide a return flow of hydraulic fluid, used by component(s) <b>126</b>, to hydraulic system <b>116</b>. In the illustrated example, three return lines are utilized. Of course, more than or less than three return lines are within the scope of the present disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">A first return line <b>210</b> provides a return flow of fluid from component(s) <b>126</b> to the supply tank <b>120</b>. Return line <b>210</b> is formed by corresponding connectors <b>212</b> and <b>214</b> having associated flow control mechanisms, as mentioned above. In one example in which hydraulically-powered component(s) <b>126</b> comprises a hydraulically driven motor, return line <b>210</b> comprises a motor case drain.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">A second return line <b>216</b> comprises corresponding connectors <b>218</b> and <b>220</b>. Return line <b>216</b> provides a return flow of hydraulic fluid to the hydraulic pump <b>118</b>. A third return line <b>222</b> comprises corresponding connectors <b>224</b> and <b>226</b>, and provides a return flow to sensing circuitry <b>121</b>. As such, return line <b>222</b> comprises a load sensing line that can be used by sensing circuitry <b>121</b> to sense a load or other operational characteristic of component(s) <b>126</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">One or more of the connectors of system <b>124</b>, that are associated with the return lines, can have a pressure relief valve (or other pressure relief feature) configured to open when fluid pressure reaches a pressure relief threshold or set point. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, connector <b>214</b> includes a pressure relief valve (represented by block <b>215</b>). Valve <b>215</b> is configured to open when the fluid pressure in line <b>210</b> reaches the pressure relief threshold. This pressure relief threshold is set low enough so as to prevent damage to the implement due to thermal expansion of the hydraulic fluid. As mentioned above, valve <b>215</b> is therefore configured to vent hydraulic fluid from return line <b>210</b> (i.e., while system <b>124</b> is decoupled from system <b>116</b>) to keep the fluid pressure at or below the pressure relief threshold. In one example of an agricultural implement, such as a planter, the pressure relief threshold is approximately 25 pounds per square inch (PSI).</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, hydraulic fluid recovery system <b>128</b> of hydraulic system <b>124</b> includes a reservoir <b>228</b> with a corresponding fluid recovery line <b>230</b> having connectors <b>232</b>, <b>234</b>, and <b>236</b>. During operation (i.e., while hydraulic system <b>124</b> is coupled to hydraulic system <b>116</b>), the return flow of hydraulic fluid through return line <b>210</b> actuates a flow control mechanism <b>238</b> from a first position (which prevents fluid flow through line <b>210</b>) to a second position (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) that allows fluid flow through line <b>210</b>. This actuation of mechanism <b>238</b> allows the return flow through connectors <b>214</b> and connector <b>212</b>, and into supply reservoir <b>120</b>. In the illustrated example, mechanism <b>238</b> comprises a shuttle valve.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates systems <b>116</b> and <b>124</b> in a disconnected state, in which the support machine <b>100</b> and agricultural implement <b>102</b> are hydraulically disconnected from each other. By way of example, to decouple implement <b>102</b> from support machine <b>100</b>, an operator disconnects the set of connectors <b>202</b> from the set of connectors <b>200</b>. Then, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the operator connects the return line connectors <b>214</b>, <b>220</b>, and <b>226</b> to connectors <b>232</b>, <b>234</b>, and <b>236</b>, respectively, of fluid recovery line <b>230</b>, which mechanically opens the corresponding flow control mechanisms associated with connectors <b>214</b>, <b>220</b>, <b>226</b>, <b>232</b>, <b>234</b>, and <b>236</b>. In this manner, the return lines <b>210</b>, <b>216</b>, <b>222</b> are fluidically coupled to the reservoir <b>228</b> of fluid recovery system <b>128</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Fluid recovery system <b>128</b> is configured such that hydraulic fluid flows into, and is stored by, reservoir <b>228</b> when the fluid pressure in any of lines <b>210</b>, <b>216</b>, and <b>222</b> reaches or exceeds a fluid recovery threshold. In one example, the fluid recovery threshold is set to be lower than the above-mentioned pressure relief threshold, above which point damage to the implement may occur due to high pressure. In one example, the fluid recovery threshold is a function of the configuration of reservoir <b>228</b>, which applies a back pressure to the fluid in fluid recovery line <b>230</b>. For instance, reservoir <b>228</b> can be elevated with respect to the return lines, such that the back pressure is a function of gravity on the fluid flow. One example of an elevated, vented fluid reservoir is discussed below with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Alternatively, or in addition, reservoir <b>228</b> can comprise a pressurized accumulator. Examples of discussed below with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>. Briefly, however, a pressurized accumulator can comprise a diaphragm, bladder, piston or other component that applies a biasing force against fluid received in an accumulation chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The above-mentioned fluid recovery threshold can be set depending on the particular components of agricultural implement <b>102</b>. For instance, the fluid recovery threshold can be set below a point where spontaneous implement component deployment occurs. Alternatively, or in addition, the fluid recovery threshold can be set below a point where structural damage (e.g., motor shaft seals, etc.) to, or fluid leakage from, implement <b>102</b> (e.g., through valve <b>215</b>) would occur. In one example agricultural implement, the fluid recovery threshold is less than approximately 25 pounds per square inch (PSI), but greater than approximately 5 PSI.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">When agricultural implement <b>102</b> is subsequently recoupled to support machine <b>100</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), fluid connection <b>214</b> is coupled to fluid connection <b>212</b> associated with supply reservoir <b>120</b>. When this occurs, a discharge fluid path is formed from reservoir <b>228</b> to supply reservoir <b>120</b>. More specifically, the discharge fluid path runs through line <b>230</b>, discharge bypass line <b>239</b>, valve <b>238</b> (in the closed position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), and connectors <b>214</b> and <b>212</b>. This discharge fluid path allows the previously accumulated/recovered hydraulic fluid to be returned to supply reservoir <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref> illustrate another example of a hydraulic fluid recovery system <b>400</b> for hydraulic system <b>124</b>. Hydraulic fluid recovery system <b>400</b> is similar, in some respects, to system <b>128</b> discussed above. However, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> in which the set of connectors <b>202</b> is disconnected from the set of connectors <b>200</b>, connectors <b>214</b>, <b>220</b> and <b>226</b> do not require reconnection to fluid recovery line <b>230</b>. Also, system <b>400</b> does not include check valves to connect the return lines to the fluid recovery line <b>230</b>. The back pressure associated with reservoir <b>228</b> is below the pressure relief threshold of pressure relief valve <b>215</b> associated with connector <b>214</b>. In one particular example, valve <b>215</b> is configured to open at 25 PSI. In this case, the fluid recovery threshold, which is a function of the back pressure applied by reservoir <b>228</b>, is less than 25 PSI (e.g., 24 PSI or less). As such, the reservoir <b>228</b> will receive and store the hydraulic fluid when the pressure in return line <b>210</b> reaches the fluid recovery threshold, thus preventing the pressure from reaching a point at which valve <b>215</b> would open (i.e., 25 PSI in the above example). In another example, the fluid recovery threshold is set to approximately 20 PSI. In another example, the fluid recovery threshold is set to approximately 15 PSI.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The pressure threshold can also be set to a relatively low pressure (e.g., less than approximately 10 PSI), which can allow some fluid to flow to reservoir <b>228</b> during operation of implement <b>102</b>, i.e., due to operational pressure spikes in the fluid circuitry. In one example, the back pressure is set to be approximately 6 PSI. To illustrate, in the case of planter, a hydraulically operated row unit may experience a pressure spike due to variations in operational characteristics. This pressure spike is dampened by the accumulation of hydraulic fluid in reservoir <b>228</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, a flow control mechanism <b>402</b> couples return line <b>222</b> to fluid recovery line <b>230</b>. Flow control mechanism <b>402</b> is configured to bleed off pressure from return line <b>222</b> to line <b>230</b>, when the pressure reaches a threshold. In one example, mechanism <b>402</b> comprises a bleed down orifice, or other flow control mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, other hydraulic circuits <b>404</b> and <b>406</b> (e.g., coupled to other hydraulically-powered components) are coupled to return line <b>210</b> through corresponding thermal relief valves <b>408</b> and <b>410</b>. Thermal relief valves <b>408</b> and <b>410</b> operate to bleed down pressure when the pressure from hydraulic circuits <b>404</b> and <b>406</b> reach a thermal relief pressure threshold.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates one example of a hydraulic fluid recovery reservoir (e.g., reservoir <b>228</b>) in the form of a vented tank <b>600</b>. Tank <b>600</b> includes an inlet port <b>602</b> configured to receive a flow of hydraulic fluid from a hydraulic fluid recovery line (e.g., line <b>230</b>). A chamber <b>604</b> that is vented to atmosphere (via vent port <b>606</b>) is configured to receive and store the hydraulic fluid. Vent port <b>606</b> includes an air valve (represented by block <b>608</b>) and/or air filter, that is configured to allow air to flow into and out of chamber <b>604</b>. In this example, back pressure is applied to the fluid due to the elevation of chamber <b>604</b> relative to the hydraulic fluid recovery line from which the fluid is received.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref> illustrate examples of a hydraulic fluid recovery reservoir (e.g., reservoir <b>228</b>) in the form of gas-charged hydraulic fluid accumulators.

Vessel housing <b>702</b> forms a fluid chamber <b>706</b> configured to receive and store the hydraulic fluid. A gas-filled bag or bladder <b>708</b> has a pre-charge pressure, which applies back pressure against the fluid in chamber <b>706</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Accumulator <b>800</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a piston-type accumulator having a cylinder housing <b>802</b> with a inlet <b>804</b> into a fluid chamber <b>806</b>. A piston <b>808</b> separates the fluid chamber <b>806</b> from a gas-filled chamber <b>810</b>. As fluid enters chamber <b>806</b>, piston <b>808</b> moves away from the inlet (i.e., upward in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>), which compresses the gas in chamber <b>810</b> and applies back pressure against the fluid.</p>

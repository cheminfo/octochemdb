<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A lower back support can be configured to attach to a ballistic vest. The lower back support can be configured to endorse true lordosis of the lumbo-sacro region of the spine, cooperate with the ballistic vest to provide passive resistance to forward being of a wearer, and/or enhance proper posture of a wearer. The lower back support can be configured to provide ballistic protection, such as to the lumbo-sacral spine. Thus, discomfort such as lower back pain can be mitigates for personnel such as soldiers and police officers who wear body armor.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">PRIORITY CLAIM</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This patent application claims the benefit of the priority date of U.S. provisional patent application Ser. No. 61/160,615, filed on Mar. 16, 2009 and entitled ERGO-M.A.S.S/ERGO-P.A.S.S. (docket no. M-16530-V3 US) pursuant to 35 USC 119. The entire contents of this provisional patent application are hereby expressly incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<?cross-reference-to-related-applications description="Cross Reference To Related Applications" end="tail"?>
<?summary-of-invention description="Summary of Invention" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to body armor. The present invention relates more particularly, for example, to methods and systems for providing support, such as lower back support, to wearers of body armor.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Body armor, also commonly know as ballistic armor, for protecting soldiers and police officers from gunshots and the like is well known. Body armor is typically styled in the form of a vest which is often referred to as a bullet proof vest, bullet resistant vest, or ballistic vest. Body armor is typically made of Kevlar (a trademark of E.I. DuPont DeNemours, Inc.) or the like and is generally effective against handgun bullets and thus can save the life of the wearer. More robust body armor, such as that using ceramic or composite inserts, is available for more deadly threats, e.g., rifle bullets.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Although such contemporary body armor has proven generally suitable for its intended purpose, it does tend to possess inherent deficiencies which detract from its overall comfort and desirability. For example, contemporary body armor does not provide lower back support. Soldiers and police offices generally carry a substantially amount of equipment. This equipment, as well as the body armor itself, contributes to the total amount of weight carried by a soldier or police officer. A soldier or police officer may have to carry 20-40 lbs. of equipment. A ballistic vest alone can weight 10-15 lbs. This weight tends to increase stress upon the lower back causing discomfort and medical problems.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Thus, it is desirable to provide a system for mitigating lower back stress, such as by providing support to the lower back when body armor is worn.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In accordance with embodiments further described herein, a body armor support system is provided. For example, in one embodiment a lower back support is configured to attach to a ballistic vest. In another embodiment, a body armor support system comprises a ballistic vest and a lower back support configured to attach to the ballistic vest. In yet another embodiment, an attachment pad is configured to attach a lower back support to a ballistic vest.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The lower back support can be either removably attachable to the ballistic vest or can be permanently attached, e.g., sewn, there to. The lower back support can be formed of ballistic material, so as to provide ballistic protection to the wearer. Alternatively, the lower back support can be formed of non-ballistic material such that it does not provide ballistic protection to the wearer.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to an embodiment, an attachment pad can be configured to attach a lower back support to a ballistic vest. The attachment pad can attach the lower back support to the ballistic vest either permanently, such as via sewing, or removably, such as via hook and loop fasteners, buckles, buttons, zippers or in any other desired manner.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">One or more embodiments can enhance comfort by mitigating lower back pain and can enhance safety by providing ballistic protection to a wearer.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">These and other features and advantages of the present invention will be more readily apparent from the detailed description of the embodiments set forth below taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.</p>

<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Embodiments of the present invention and their advantages are best understood by referring to the detailed description that follows. It should be appreciated that like reference numerals are used to identify like elements illustrated in one or more of the figures.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">As examples, methods and systems for providing lower back support while wearing a ballistic vest are disclosed. According to an embodiment, a lower back support is configured to attach to a ballistic vest.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">For example, the lower back support can be configured to endorse true lordosis of the lumbo-sacro region of the spine. As a further example, the lower back support can be configured to cooperate with the ballistic vest to provide passive resistance to forward bending of a wearer. As yet a further example, the lower back support can be configured to enhance proper posture of a wearer. As yet a further example, the lower back support can be configured to correct center of gravity of a wearer.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Accordingly to an embodiment, the lower back support can be removably attachable to the ballistic vest, such as to the lower, outer aspect of the ballistic vest. For example, the lower back support can attach to the ballistic vest via hook and loop fasteners. As further examples, the lower back support can attach to the vest via one or more buttons and/or zippers. The lower back support can removably attach to the ballistic vest via any desire method or device.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Accordingly to an embodiment, the lower back support can be permanently attached to the ballistic vest. For example, the lower back support can attach to the ballistic vest via sewing. As further examples, the lower back support can attach to the vest via adhesive bonding, ultrasonic welding, and/or rivets. The lower back support can removably attach to the ballistic vest via any desire method or device.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">As discussed below, an attachment pad can be used to attach the lower back support to the ballistic vest. Alternatively, the lower back support can attach directly to the ballistic vest. The lower back support can attach to the ballistic vest in any desired manner, with or without an intermediate item (such as the attachment pad).</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Accordingly to an embodiment, the lower back support can be attached to the ballistic vest via an attachment pad. The attachment pad can be either removably attachable to the ballistic vest or can be permanently attached thereto. The attachment pad can be either removably attachable to the lower back support or can be permanently attached thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The lower back support can be provided along with a ballistic vest or separately with respect to a ballistic vest. The lower back support can be worn along with a ballistic vest or separately with respect to a ballistic vest. The lower back support can be worn with a ballistic vest while attached thereto or can be with a ballistic vest while not attached thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The ballistic vest, the lower back support, and/or the attachment pad can comprise a ballistic material. The ballistic vest, the lower back support, and/or the attachment pad can comprise any desired material, e.g. Kevlar (a trademark of E.I. DuPont DeNemours, Inc.) or nylon.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a semi-schematic back view of the body armor support system <b>100</b> is provided, according to an example of an embodiment. The body armor support system <b>100</b> can comprise a ballistic vest <b>101</b> or the like. The body armor support system <b>100</b> can further comprise a lower back support <b>301</b>. The lower back support <b>301</b> can attach to the ballistic vest via an attachment pad <b>201</b>, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The attachment pad <b>201</b> can be of any desired shape and can be formed of any desired material. For example, the attachment pad <b>201</b> can be generally rectangular and can comprise Kevlar (a trademark of E.I. DuPont DeNemours, Inc.) that is sewn inside of a nylon lining or pocket. The lining can comprise an elastic material to better facilitate compatibility, e.g., fit, of the attachment pad <b>201</b> with respect to the ballistic vest <b>101</b> and/or the lower back support <b>301</b>. The use of elastic material in the line can also make the attachment pad <b>301</b> better conform to the wearer and thereby enhance comfort.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The ballistic vest <b>101</b> can comprise upper straps <b>102</b> that go over the wearer's shoulders. The ballistic vest <b>101</b> can comprise lower straps <b>103</b> that pass around the wearer's waist. The straps <b>102</b> and <b>103</b> can couple to one another and/or to the ballistic vest <b>101</b> via hook and loop fasteners, buckles, buttons, or any other desired method or device.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">One example of a suitable ballistic is the C-Series ballistic vest sold by Point Blank Body Armor of Pompano Beach, Fla. This ballistic vest is shown on the Internet at:</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0000">http://www.pointblanksolutionsinc.com/pointblankarmor_com/LE<sub>&#x2014;</sub>1_CSERIES.html,
<br/>
the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference.
<br/>
Those skilled in the art will appreciate that other ballistic vests are also suitable.
</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0031">The lower back support <b>301</b> can lack the shoulder straps that are present on some contemporary lower back supports. Such shoulder straps are not necessary because attachment of the lower back support <b>301</b> to the ballistic vest <b>101</b> provides sufficient support for the lower back support <b>301</b>. The lower backs support can attach to itself in the front via hook and loop fasteners, buckles, buttons, or any other desired method or device.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0032">One example of a suitable lower back support is the Bioskin Lumbar Back Support sold by SupportsUSA of Addison, Tex. This back support is shown on the Internet at:</p>

The attachment pad <b>201</b> can removably attach to the ballistic vest <b>101</b> via hook and loop fasteners, buttons, zippers and/or any other desired method or device. The lower back support <b>201</b> can permanently attach to the ballistic vest <b>101</b> via sewing and/or any other desire method or device.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0035">Similarly, the attachment pad <b>201</b> can removably attach to the lower back support <b>301</b> via hook and loop fasteners, buttons, zippers and/or any other desired method or device. The lower back support can permanently attach to the lower back support <b>301</b> via sewing and/or any other desire method or device.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0036">The attachment pad <b>201</b> can removably attach to both the ballistic vest <b>101</b> and the lower back support <b>301</b>. The attachment pad <b>201</b> can permanently attach to both the ballistic vest <b>101</b> and the lower back support <b>301</b>.

<p id="p-0042" num="0039">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a semi-schematic back view of the body armor support system <b>100</b> without the lower back support is provided, according to an example of an embodiment. The attachment pad <b>201</b> can be attached to the ballistic vest <b>101</b> without also attaching the attachment pad <b>201</b> to a lower back support <b>301</b>. The attachment pad <b>201</b> can be configured so as to provide at least some support without the lower back support <b>301</b>. The attachment pad can be formed of a ballistic material so as to provide enhanced protection (with respect to the ballistic vest <b>101</b> alone).</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0040">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a semi-schematic enlarged back view of the body armor support system <b>100</b> without the lower back support is provided, according to an example of an embodiment. The attachment pad can comprise a lower portion <b>205</b> and an upper portion <b>206</b>. The lower portion <b>205</b> can comprise hook and loop fasteners, for example, for facilitating attachment thereof to a lower back support <b>301</b>. The upper portion <b>206</b> can comprise hook and loop fasteners, for example, for facilitating attachment thereof to the ballistic vest <b>101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0041">According to this embodiment, the upper portion <b>206</b> of the attachment pad <b>201</b> can be configured as a flap that folds away from the lower portion <b>205</b> thereof. Hook and loop fasteners <b>207</b> can hold the flap or upper portion <b>206</b> to the lower portion <b>205</b> when the upper portion <b>206</b> is not attached to the ballistic vest <b>101</b>. The hook and loop fasteners <b>207</b> can be used to attach the attachment pad <b>201</b> to a lower back support, if desired.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0042">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a semi-schematic back view of the attachment pad <b>201</b> is provided, according to an example of an embodiment. A back surface <b>211</b> of the attachment pad <b>201</b> faces outwardly, away from the wearer. The upper portion <b>206</b> of the attachment pad <b>201</b> is shown folded downwardly, against the lower portion <b>205</b> thereof. Hook and loop fasteners <b>221</b> are formed on the upper portion <b>206</b> of the attachment pad <b>201</b> to facilitate attachment of the attachment pad <b>201</b> to the ballistic vest <b>101</b>. Hook and loop fasteners <b>222</b> are formed on the lower portion <b>205</b> of the attachment pad <b>201</b> to facilitate attachment of the attachment pad <b>201</b> to the lower back support <b>301</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0043">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a semi-schematic front view of the attachment pad is provided, according to an example of an embodiment. A front surface <b>212</b> of the attachment pad <b>201</b> faces inwardly, toward from the wearer. The flap or upper portion <b>206</b> of the attachment pad <b>201</b> is shown folded downwardly, against the lower portion <b>205</b> thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0044">To use the body armor support system <b>100</b>, the attachment pad <b>201</b> can be used to attach the lower back support <b>301</b> to the ballistic vest <b>101</b> prior to wearing the body armor support system <b>100</b>. The assembly (attached) body armor support system <b>100</b> can then be worn by connecting the upper straps <b>102</b> and the lower straps <b>103</b> of the ballistic vest <b>101</b> about the user's body and by attaching the lower back support <b>301</b> in the front thereof. Such use of the body armor support system <b>100</b> can generally be accomplished by the wearer alone.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0045">Alternatively, the body armor support system <b>100</b> can be used by first putting on either one of the ballistic vest <b>101</b> and the lower back support <b>301</b> and then putting on the other of the ballistic vest <b>101</b> and the lower back support <b>301</b>. Once both the ballistic vest <b>101</b> and the lower back support <b>301</b> are comfortably on the user and the straps thereof are correctly adjusted, then the attachment pad <b>201</b> can be attached to the ballistic vest <b>101</b> and the lower back support <b>301</b>. In this manner, the lower back support <b>301</b> can be attached to the ballistic vest <b>101</b> for best fit. Generally, the help of another person is required for this alternative procedure. This alternative procedure can thus be used for initial fitting of the body armor support system <b>100</b> and the previously discussed procedure can then be used thereafter.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0046">Optionally, the lower back support <b>301</b> and/or the attachment pad <b>201</b> can be configured to provide ballistic protection. For example, the lower back support <b>301</b> and/or the attachment pad <b>201</b> can be configured to provide ballistic protection to the lumbo-sacral spine. Thus, the lower back support <b>301</b> and/or the attachment pad <b>201</b> can comprise a ballistic material, such as Kevlar (a trademark of E.I. DuPont DeNemours, Inc.).</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0047">The lower back support <b>301</b> and/or the attachment pad <b>201</b> can be configured so as not to provide ballistic protection. Thus, the lower back support <b>301</b> and/or the attachment pad <b>201</b> can comprise a non-ballistic material, such as nylon.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0048">Where hook and loop fasteners are used, either male hook and loop fasteners, female hook and loop fasteners, or a combination of both male and female hook and loop fasteners can be used. Thus, both male and female hook and loop fasteners can be provided at any give location of an embodiment so as to assure compatibility with a complimentary hook and loop fasteners. For example, both male and female hook and loop fasteners can be provided on the attachment pad <b>201</b> for attaching the attachment pad <b>201</b> to the ballistic vest <b>101</b> (and/or to the lower back support <b>301</b>). In this manner, compatibility of the hook and loop fasteners of the attachment pad <b>201</b> with the hook and fasteners of the ballistic vest <b>101</b> (and/or to the lower back support <b>301</b>) is assured.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0049">Thus, discomfort such as lower back pain can be mitigated for personnel such as soldiers and police officers who wear body armor. More particularly, the lower back support can be configured to endorse true lordosis of the lumbo-sacro region of the spine, cooperate with the ballistic vest to provide passive resistance to forward bending of a wearer, enhance proper posture of a wearer, and/or correct center of gravity of a wearer. Moreover, embodiments can mitigate the likelihood of over-use syndromes, paraplegia, quadriplegia, non-mortal, and mortal wounds.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0050">The term &#x201c;ballistic protection&#x201d; as used herein can refer to an ability to inhibit injury due to gunshot, knife stabbing, flying shrapnel, and the like. The term &#x201c;ballistic material&#x201d; as used herein can refer to a material, such as Kevlar (a trademark of E.I. DuPont DeNemours, Inc.), that is capable of providing ballistic protection.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0051">The term &#x201c;ballistic vest&#x201d; as used herein is by way of example only, and not by way of limitation. As those skilled in the art will appreciate, the lower back support can be used with or attached to various types of body armor, including a ballistic vest. Thus, the term ballistic vest, as used herein, can refer to any type of body armor with which the lower back support can be used or attached to.</p>

<paragraph id="A-00001" lvl="0">This invention relates to a vacuum processing apparatus having vacuum processing chambers the insides of which must be dry cleaned, and to a method of operating such an apparatus. When the vacuum processing chambers are dry-cleaned, dummy substrates are transferred into the vacuum processing chamber by substrates conveyor means from dummy substrate storage means which is disposed in the air atmosphere together with storage means for storing substrates to be processed, and the inside of the vacuum processing chamber is dry-cleaned by generating a plasma. The dummy substrate is returned to the dummy substrate storage means after dry cleaning is completed. Accordingly, any specific mechanism for only the cleaning purpose is not necessary and the construction of the apparatus can be made simple. Furthermore, the dummy substrates used for dry cleaning and the substrates to be processed do not coexist, contamination of the substrates to be processed due to dust and remaining gas can be prevented and the production yield can be high.  </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-00002" lvl="2"><number>2.</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00003" lvl="0"><number>3.</number> This invention relates to a vacuum processing apparatus and operating method therefor. More specifically, the present invention relates to a vacuum processing apparatus having vacuum processing chambers the inside of which must be cleaned, and its operating method. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00004" lvl="2"><number>4.</number> 2. Description of the Prior Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00005" lvl="0"><number>5.</number> In a vacuum processing apparatus such as a dry etching apparatus, a CVD apparatus or a sputtering apparatus, a predetermined number of substrates to be treated are stored as one unit (which is generally referred to as a &ldquo;lot&rdquo;) in a substrate cassette and are loaded in the apparatus. The substrates after being processed are likewise stored in the same unit in the substrate cassette and are recovered. This is an ordinary method of operating these apparatuses to improve the productivity. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00006" lvl="0"><number>6.</number> In such a vacuum processing apparatus described above, particularly in an apparatus which utilizes a reaction by an active gas, as typified by a dry etching apparatus and a CVD apparatus, reaction products adhere to and are deposited on a vacuum processing chamber with the progress of processing. For this reason, problems such as degradation of vacuum performance, the increase of dust, the drop of the levels of optical monitoring signals occur. To solve these problems, conventionally the insides of the vacuum processing chambers are cleaned periodically. Cleaning operations include so-called &ldquo;wet cleaning&rdquo; which is wiping-off of the adhering matters by use of an organic solvent, etc., and so-called &ldquo;dry cleaning&rdquo; in which an active gas or plasma is used for decomposing adhering matters. Dry cleaning is superior from the aspect of the working factor and efficiency. These features of the dry cleaning have become essential with the progress in automation of production lines. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00007" lvl="0"><number>7.</number> An example of vacuum processing apparatuses having such a dry cleaning function is disclosed in Japanese Utility Model Laid-Open No. 127125/1988. This apparatus includes a preliminary vacuum chamber for introducing wafers to be treated into a processing chamber from an atmospheric side on a vacuum side, which is disposed adjacent to the processing chamber through a gate valve, dummy wafers are loaded in the preliminary vacuum chamber and are transferred into the processing chamber by exclusive conveyor means before the processing chamber is subjected to dry cleaning, and the dummy wafer is returned to the vacuum preparatory chamber by the conveyor means after dry cleaning is completed. </paragraph>

<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-00008" lvl="0"><number>8.</number> In the prior art technology described above, the structure of the vacuum processing apparatus is not much considered. The preliminary vacuum chamber for storing the dummy wafers must have a large capacity, the exclusive conveyor means is necessary for transferring the dummy wafers and thus, the apparatus is complicated in structure. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00009" lvl="0"><number>9.</number> Dummy wafers used for plasma cleaning are again returned to the preliminary vacuum chamber and are made to stand by. In this instance, reaction products generated during plasma cleaning and residual gas used for plasma cleaning adhere on the used dummy wafers. Thereafter, normal processing for wafers is resumed. Therefore, the used dummy wafers and unprocessed wafers exist in mixture inside the preliminary vacuum chamber and this state is not desirable from the aspect of contamination of unprocessed wafers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00010" lvl="0"><number>10.</number> The present invention provides a vacuum processing apparatus which solves the problems described above, is simple in structure, prevents contamination of unprocessed substrates and accomplishes a high production yield. A vacuum processing apparatus having vacuum processing chambers the insides of which are dry-cleaned after substrates to be treated are processed in vacuum is provided with first storage means for storing substrates to be treated, second storage means for storing dummy substrates, the first and second storage means being disposed in the air, conveyor means for transferring the substrates to be processed between the first storage means and the vacuum processing chambers and for transferring the dummy substrates between the second storage means and the vacuum processing chambers, and control means for controlling the conveyor means so as to transfer the dummy substrates between the second storage means and the vacuum processing chambers before and after dry cleaning of the vacuum processing chambers. A method of operating a vacuum processing apparatus having vacuum processing chambers the insides of which are dry-cleaned after substrates to be processed are processed in vacuum comprises the steps of disposing first storage means for storing the substrates to be processed together with second storage means for storing dummy substrates in the air atmosphere, transferring the substrates to be processed between the first storage means and the vacuum processing chambers and vacuum-processing the substrates to be processed, and transferring the dummy substrates between the second storage means and the vacuum processing chambers before and after dry-cleaning of the vacuum processing chambers. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-00013" lvl="0"><number>13.</number> As substrates to be processed are processed in a vacuum processing apparatus, reaction products adhere to and are deposited in vacuum processing chambers. The reaction products adhering to and deposited in the vacuum processing chambers are removed by disposing dummy wafers inside the vacuum processing chambers and by conducting dry-cleaning. To carry out dry cleaning, the timings of dry cleaning of the vacuum processing chambers are determined and during or after the processing of a predetermined number of substrates to be processed, dummy substrates are conveyed by substrate conveyor means from dummy substrate storage means disposed in the air atmosphere together with processed substrate storage means, and are then disposed inside the vacuum processing chambers. After the dummy substrates are thus disposed, a plasma is generated inside each of the vacuum processing chambers to execute dry-cleaning inside the vacuum processing chamber. After dry-cleaning inside the vacuum processing chambers is completed, the dummy substrates are returned from the vacuum processing chambers to the dummy substrate storage means by the substrate conveyor means. In this manner, a preliminary vacuum chamber and an exclusive transfer mechanism both necessary in prior art techniques become unnecessary, and the apparatus structure gets simplified. The dummy substrates used for the dry-cleaning and the substrates to be processed do not co-exist inside the same chamber, so that contamination of substrates to be processed due to dust and remaining gas is prevented and a high production yield can be achieved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00014" lvl="0"><number>14.</number> Hereinafter, an embodiment of the present invention will be explained with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>

The etching chamber <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>includes a gas introduction device <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>for introducing a processing gas in the discharge portion <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and an evacuating device <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>for decreasing the internal pressure of the etching chamber <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>to a predetermined pressure. The etching chamber <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight> further includes generation means for generating a microwave and a magnetic field for converting processing gas in the discharge portion <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>to plasma. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00020" lvl="0"><number>20.</number> A sensor <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> for measuring the intensity of plasma light is disposed at an upper part of the etching chamber. The measured value of the sensor <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> is inputted to a controller <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>. The controller <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> compares the measured value from the sensor <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> with a predetermined one and determines the timing of cleaning inside the etching chamber. The controller <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> controls the conveyors <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to control the transfer of the dummy wafers <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> between the cassette <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>and the etching chambers <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00021" lvl="0"><number>21.</number> In a vacuum processing apparatus having the construction described above, the cassettes <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight> storing unprocessed wafers are first placed onto the cassette tables <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>by a line transfer robot which operates on the basis of the data sent from a host control apparatus, or by an operator. On the other hand, the cassette <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>storing the dummy wafers is placed on the cassette table <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>. The vacuum processing apparatus executes the wafer processing or plasma cleaning on the basis of recognition by itself of the production data provided on the cassettes <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, of the data sent from the host control apparatus, or of the command inputted by an operator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00022" lvl="0"><number>22.</number> For instance, the wafers <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are sequentially loaded in the order from above into the etching chambers <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>by the conveyors <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, and are etched. The etched wafers are stored in their original positions inside the cassette <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>by the conveyors <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. In this case, from the start to the end of the operation, without changing the position and posture of the cassettes, the unprocessed wafers are taken out from the cassettes and are returned in their original positions where the wafers have been stored, and are stored there. In this manner, the apparatus can easily cope with automation of the production line, contamination of the wafers due to dust can be reduced and high production efficiency and high production yield can thus be  accomplished. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00023" lvl="0"><number>23.</number> As etching is repeated, the reaction products adhere to and are deposited on the inner wall of the etching chambers <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>. Therefore, the original state must be recovered by removing the adhering matters by plasma cleaning. The controller <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> judges the timing of this plasma cleaning. In this case, a portion through which the plasma light passes is provided in each of the etching chambers <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>. The sensor <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> measures the intensity of the plasma light passing through this portion and when the measured value reaches a predetermined one, the start timing of plasma cleaning is judged. Alternatively, the timing of plasma cleaning may be judged by counting the number of wafers processed in each etching chamber by the controller <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and judging the timing when this value reaches a predetermined value. The actual timing of plasma cleaning that is carried out may be during a processing of a predetermined number of wafers in the cassette <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>or <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, after the processing of all the wafers <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> in a cassette is completed and before the processing of wafers in the next cassette. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00024" lvl="0"><number>24.</number> Plasma cleaning is carried out in the following sequence. In this case, the explanation will be given about a case where the etching chambers <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>are subjected to plasma cleaning by using three dummy wafers <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> among the dummy wafers <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> (twenty-five dummy wafers are stored in this case) stored in the cassette <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00025" lvl="0"><number>25.</number> Dummy wafers <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> which are stored in the cassette <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>and are not used yet or can be used because the number of times of use for plasma cleaning is below a predetermined one are drawn by the conveyor <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight>. At this time, dummy wafers <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> stored in any position in the cassette <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>may be used but in this case, the position numbers of the dummy wafers in the cassette and their number of times of use are stored in the controller <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight>, and accordingly dummy wafers having smaller numbers of times of use are drawn preferentially. Then, the dummy wafers <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are loaded in the load lock chamber <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> disposed on the opposite side to the cassette <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>by the conveyor <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> through the gate valve <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in the same way as the transfer at the time of etching of wafers <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. After the gate valve <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is closed, the load lock chamber <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is evacuated to a predetermined pressure by the vacuum exhaust device <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and then the gate valves <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are opened. The dummy wafers <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are transferred by the conveyor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> from the load lock chamber <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> to the etching chamber <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>through the transfer chamber <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and are placed on the sample table <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. After the gate valve <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is closed, plasma cleaning is carried out in the etching chamber <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in which the dummy wafers <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are disposed, under a predetermined condition. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00026" lvl="0"><number>26.</number> In the interim, the gate valves <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are closed and the pressure of the load lock chamber <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> is returned to the atmospheric pressure by the gas introduction device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>. Next, the gate valve <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is opened and the second dummy wafer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is loaded in the load lock chamber <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> by the conveyor <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> in the same way as the first dummy wafer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, and evacuation is effected again by the evacuating device <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to a predetermined pressure after closing the gate valve <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. Thereafter, the gate valves <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>are opened and the second dummy wafer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is transferred from the load lock chamber <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> to the etching chamber <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>through the transfer chamber <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> by the conveyor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Plasma cleaning is started after the gate valve <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is closed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00027" lvl="0"><number>27.</number> In the interim, the third dummy wafer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is transferred into the etching chamber <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>in the same way as the second dummy wafer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> and plasma cleaning is carried out. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00028" lvl="0"><number>28.</number> After plasma cleaning is completed in the etching chamber <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>in which the first dummy wafer <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> is placed, the gate valves <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>are opened. The used dummy wafer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> is transferred from the etching chamber <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to the unload lock chamber <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> by the conveyor <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Then, the gate valve <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>is closed. After the pressure of the unload lock chamber <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is returned to the atmospheric pressure by the gas introduction device <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, the gate valve <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>is opened. The used dummy wafer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> transferred to the unload lock chamber <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is taken out in the air by the conveyor <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> through the gate valve <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>and is returned to its original position in the cassette <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>in which it is stored at the start. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00029" lvl="0"><number>29.</number> When plasma cleaning of the etching chambers <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight> and <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>is completed, the second and third dummy wafers <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> are returned to their original positions in the cassette <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00030" lvl="0"><number>30.</number> In this way, the used dummy wafers <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are returned to their original positions in the cassette <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>and the dummy wafers <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are always stocked in the cassette <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>. When all the dummy wafers <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> in the cassette <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>are used for plasma cleaning or when the numbers of times of use of the wafers <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> reach the predetermined ones after the repetition of use, the dummy wafers <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> are replaced as a whole together with the cassette <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>. The timing of this replacement of the cassette is managed by the controller <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> and the replacement is instructed to the host control apparatus for controlling the line transfer robot or to the operator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00031" lvl="0"><number>31.</number> Although the explanation given above deals with the case where the etching chambers <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>are continuously plasma-cleaned by the use of three dummy wafers <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> among the dummy wafers <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> in the cassette <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, other processing methods may be employed, as well. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00032" lvl="0"><number>32.</number> For example, the etching chambers <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>are sequentially plasma-cleaned by the use of one dummy wafer <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>. In the case of such plasma cleaning, unprocessed wafers <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> can be etched in etching chambers other than the one subjected to plasma cleaning, and plasma cleaning can thus be carried out without interrupting etching. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00033" lvl="0"><number>33.</number> If the processing chambers are different, for example, there are an etching chamber, a post-processing chamber and a film-formation chamber, and wafers are sequentially processed while passing through each of these processing chambers, each of the processing chambers can be subjected appropriately to plasma cleaning by sending dummy wafers <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> during the processing of the wafers <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight> which are stored in the cassette <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>or <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and drawn and sent sequentially, by passing merely the dummy wafers <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> through the processing chambers for which plasma cleaning is not necessary, and by executing plasma cleaning only when the dummy wafers <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight> reach the processing chambers which need plasma cleaning. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00034" lvl="0"><number>34.</number> According to the embodiment described above, the cassette storing the dummy wafers and the cassettes storing the wafers to be processed are disposed together in the air, the dummy wafers are loaded from the cassette into the apparatus by the same conveyor as the conveyor for transferring the wafers, at the time of cleaning, and the used dummy wafers are returned to their original positions in the cassette. In this way, a mechanism for conducting exclusively plasma cleaning need not be provided, and the construction of the apparatus can be simplified. It is not necessary to handle plasma cleaning as a particular processing sequence, but the plasma cleaning can be incorporated in an ordinary etching processing and can be carried out efficiently in a series of operations. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00035" lvl="0"><number>35.</number> The dummy wafers used for plasma cleaning are returned to their original positions in the cassette placed in the air. Accordingly, the used dummy wafers and the wafers before and after processing do not exist mixedly in the vacuum chamber, so that contamination of wafers due to dust and remaining gas does not occur unlike conventional apparatuses. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00036" lvl="0"><number>36.</number> The used dummy wafers are returned to their original positions in the cassette and the numbers of times of their use is managed. Accordingly, it is possible to prevent the confusion of the used dummy wafers with the unused dummy wafers and the confusion of the dummy wafers having small numbers of times of use with the dummy wafers having large numbers of times of use. For these reasons, the dummy wafers can be used effectively without any problem when plasma cleaning is carried out. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00037" lvl="0"><number>37.</number> Furthermore, in accordance with the present invention, the apparatus can have a plurality of processing chambers and can transfer wafers and dummy wafers by the same conveyor. Since plasma cleaning can be carried out by managing the timing of cleaning of each processing chamber by the controller, the cleaning cycle can be set arbitrarily, dry cleaning can be carried out without interrupting the flow of the processing, the processing can be efficiently made and the productivity can be improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00038" lvl="0"><number>38.</number> As described above, according to the present invention, there are effects that the construction of the apparatus is simple, the substrates to be processed are free from contamination and the production yield is high. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-00048" lvl="0"><number>48.</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> shows a first embodiment of the present invention. An exhaust gas recirculating type combined plant employing a gas turbine intake air water spraying system comprises: a compressor (compressor) <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> for sucking and compressing air, a combustion chamber <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> for mixing and burning the compressed air and fuel; a gas turbine <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> which is driven by combustion gas supplied from the combustion chamber <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>; an exhaust heat recovery boiler <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> for recovering heat of the gas turbine exhaust gas prom the gas turbine <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>  so as to generate steam by heat exchange with supplied water; a steam turbine <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> which is driven by the steam generated by the gas turbine exhaust heat recovery boiler <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, a generator <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> coupled with the steam turbine <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>; a recirculating means (pipe) <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> composing a recirculating path for taking out part of the gas turbine exhaust gas of the gas turbine <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and recirculating it up to a compressor intake; and a recirculation amount control means (exhaust gas recirculation amount adjusting valve) <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> for controlling the recirculation amount. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00049" lvl="0"><number>49.</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, although the compressor (compressor) <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, gas turbine <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, steam turbine <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and generator <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> are connected on a same axis, it is permissible to construct so that each turbine may drive each generator. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00050" lvl="0"><number>50.</number> This combined plant further comprises a fuel amount control valve (fuel supply system) <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> for controlling an amount of fuel supplied to the combustion chamber <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and an integrated control device <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> for controlling the fuel amount control valve <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> and the recirculation amount control means <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>.   </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00051" lvl="0"><number>51.</number> According to the first embodiment, spray nozzles <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>  for spraying fine droplets of liquid are disposed in a suction duct <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>. A supply water amount adjusting valve <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>  for controlling a spray amount, a water tank <highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> for storing water and a water supply pump <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> are disposed on a path for supplying water to the spray nozzles. If the aforementioned nozzle requires an air supplying means for obtaining fine liquid droplets, an air flow adjusting valve <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> is disposed on a suction air supply path. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00052" lvl="0"><number>52.</number> As for the fine droplets of liquid sprayed, its average droplet diameter (S.M.D.) is about 10 &mgr;m. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00053" lvl="0"><number>53.</number> Generation output of the aforementioned combined plant is operated by the fuel amount control valve <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> for controlling an amount of fuel loaded on the combustion chamber <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, recirculation amount control means <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, spray amount (supply water amount) adjusting valve <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>, air flow adjusting valve <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> and determined by adjusting their opening degrees. These operation ends are controlled depending on an operation signal from the integrated control device <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>.  The integrated control device <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> receives a load request signal Ld from a central power supply control room <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> for the combined plant and controls the entire plant so as to appropriately control air amount, fuel amount and spray amount. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00054" lvl="0"><number>54.</number> An example of the integrated control device will be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00055" lvl="0"><number>55.</number> To control an amount of fuel, first a deviation between a load request signal Ld and an actual load L is obtained by a subtractor AD<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and a fuel target signal Fd is obtained by an adjusting device PI<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Then, a deviation between the fuel target signal Fd and actual fuel amount F is obtained by a subtractor AD<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and them the fuel amount control valve <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is adjusted by the adjusting device PI<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to determine an amount of fuel to be loaded on the combustion chamber. According to this control, the larger the load, the larger amount of fuel is supplied to the combustion chamber <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00056" lvl="0"><number>56.</number> As for the control of recirculating amount, in a function generator FG<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> which receives the load signal Ld, the smaller the load, the larger output signal S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is obtained. This signal S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is supplied to the adjusting device PI<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> so as to control the recirculation amount control means <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>.  </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00057" lvl="0"><number>57.</number> When an operational value of combustion temperature is input to AD<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> or AD<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and the AD<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> or AD<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> makes arithmetic operation, correction is carried out as required to suppress a deflection of the combustion temperature. As for the operational value of the combustion temperature, exhaust gas temperature and compressor exit pressure are input to FG<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, in which a combustion temperature is calculated based on the gas turbine exhaust gas temperature and pressure and then output. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00058" lvl="0"><number>58.</number> As the load decreases, the recirculation amount increases in terms of supplying speed, preventing a reduction of the combustion temperature or gas turbine exhaust gas temperature accompanied by a reduction of the load. Preferably, the combustion temperature (gas turbine exhaust gas temperature) can be maintained at a substantially constant level regardless of the load. In the function generator FG<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference>, a recirculation rate of the gas turbine exhaust gas amount is determined corresponding to the load. Thus, in the example shown in the same figure, the output signal S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> of the function generator FG<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> can maintain the gas turbine exhaust gas temperature substantially constant regardless of the load. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00059" lvl="0"><number>59.</number> Like this, by recovering entropy of exhaust gas, reduction of efficiency at the time of the partial loading can be prevented. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00060" lvl="0"><number>60.</number> In this manner, the gas turbine exhaust gas temperature can be maintained at a substantially constant level regardless of the load. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00061" lvl="0"><number>61.</number> As for improvement of compressor characteristic, to prevent a drop of the combination temperature at the time of the partial load operation or a reduction of the gas turbine exhaust gas temperature. outside air of the atmospheric temperature is mixed with high temperature gas turbine exhaust gas at the compressor intake so as to obtain intake air. As the load is decreased, the gas turbine exhaust gas amount to be recirculated increases. Then, as the gas turbine exhaust gas increases, naturally the suction air temperature also increases, so that correspondingly, a temperature in the compressor <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> also increases. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>, fluid behavior in the vicinity of compressor vanes changes. Generally, a peripheral velocity of a moving vane inside the compressor is constant. If an axial velocity is designed so as to be constant, an apparent velocity B flowing to the compressor moving vane is parallel to the vane as shown in (A) . However, if the suction air temperature rises so that the gas temperature inside the compressor also rises, an incidence &agr; which is an incidence angle of the apparent velocity B is increased to increase the axial velocity A&prime; as shown in (B) Thus, at a compressor rear and in which the temperature rises (e.g., near the final stage moving vane) flow separation occurs on the vane so as to produce stalling. If this phenomenon is serious, a negative stalling is caused, so that a stable operation of the gas turbine becomes impossible. Thus, even if the recirculating amount is increased accompanied by a reduction of the gas turbine load, there exists a upper limit of the gas turbine exhaust gas recirculating amount thereby a range of the partial load operation being limited. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00062" lvl="0"><number>62.</number> According to the present embodiment, liquid droplets to be vaporized in the compressor is introduced into the suction air in which the outside air of atmospheric temperature and high temperature gas turbine exhaust gas are mixed with each other. As a result, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> (C),  internal gas of the compressor is cooled so that the axial velocity A&prime; is reduced at the rear end of the compressor. Consequently, the incidence &agr; is also reduced so that the apparent velocity B becomes parallel to the vane thereby stabilizing the compressor characteristic. Because the internal gas of the compressor can be cooled by vaporization of liquid droplets inside the compressor, the compressor suction air temperature can be further increased. That is, because the gas turbine exhaust air recirculation amount can be increased more, the high efficiency partial load operation range can be expanded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00063" lvl="0"><number>63.</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> shows a change in incidence relative to the spray amount. Ordinarily, the gas turbine is designed so as to be operated under an atmospheric temperature of 0&deg; C.-50&deg; C., In this interval, the characteristic of the compressor is stabilizer regardless of the incidence being changed by a change in the compressor suction air temperature. However, if the compressor suction air temperature exceeds this range, the absolute value of the incidence is increased, so the characteristic of the compressor becomes unstable. At the worst, a positive stalling (stall) or a negative stalling (choke) may occur. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00064" lvl="0"><number>64.</number> According to the present invention, by introducing the liquid droplets to be vaporized into the interior of the compressor, the internal gas inside the compressor is cooled so as to improve the incidence. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>,   although the incidence is at the lower limit of the regular operation range when the suction air temperature is 50&deg; C., by spraying liquid droplets at the compressor intake so as to cool the internal gas inside the compressor, the incidence is gradually restored, resulting in the incidence being restored to 0 deg with a spray amount of 1.5%. If the spray amount is increased, the problematic positive stalling (stall) requires an appropriate spray amount to be selected. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00065" lvl="0"><number>65.</number> As described above, introducing the liquid droplets to be vaporized in the compressor causes a temperature difference between the compressor intake gas and exit gas to be minimized. The intake temperature is substantially constant and the exit temperature drops or the reduction amount of the exit temperature is made larger than the reduction amount of the intake temperature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00066" lvl="0"><number>66.</number> Therefore, the recirculation amount can be increased with the compressor exit temperature being substantially constant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00067" lvl="0"><number>67.</number> Thus, the recirculation can be attained even at the time of low partial load operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00068" lvl="0"><number>68.</number> By introducing liquid droplets to be vaporized in the compressor in which the aforementioned mixing gas flows so that the liquid droplets are valorized in the compressor, the efficiency under the partial load can be improved as compared to the case of the aforementioned conventional art. The water droplets entering the compressor are vaporized and if the vaporization is completed, the gas in the compressor is subjected to adiabatic compression. At that time, the specific heat under a constant pressure of steam is about twice that of the mixing gas around a typical temperature (300&deg; C.) in the compressor and therefore, in terms of thermal capacity, if calculated on the basis of the mixing gas, the same effect is produced as when the mixing gas having a weight about twice that of water droplets to be vaporized acts as an operating liquid. That is, a drop of the mixing gas temperature at the exit of the compressor has an effect (temperature rise inhibit effect). The vaporization of water droplets in the compressor like this causes the drop of the mixing gas temperature at the exit of the compressor. An operating power of the compressor is equal to a difference of mixing gas entropy between the intake and exit of the compressor and the mixing gas entropy is proportional to the temperature. Thus, if the mixing gas temperature at the exit of the compressor drops, the required operating power of the compressor can be reduced so that the efficiency can be improved. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-00071" lvl="0"><number>71.</number> If the compressor exit temperature T<highlight><subscript>2 </subscript></highlight>drops to T<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>&prime; (&lt;T<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) due to the vaporization by mixing of sprayed water, a second term of the right side of the above expression becomes smaller, so that it is clear that the efficiency is improved by the water spray. In other words, although the thermal energy Cp (T<highlight><subscript>4</subscript></highlight>&minus;T<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>) thrown out of the gas turbine (a heat engine) does not change largely between before and after the application of the present invention, the fuel energy Cp (T<highlight><subscript>3</subscript></highlight>&minus;T<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>&prime;)  loaded is increased by Cp (T<highlight><subscript>1</subscript></highlight>&minus;T<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>&prime;) or a reduction amount of the compressor work when applying the present invention. Because the reduction amount of the compressor work is equal to an increased output, this increase of the fuel contributes substantially all to an increase of the output of the gas turbine. That is, the increased output attains a heat efficiency of 100%. Therefore, the heat efficiency of the gas turbine can be improved. Because the combustion temperature is maintained at a constant level, the heat efficiency of bottoming cycle is the same as before the present invention has been applied. Therefore, the heat efficiency of the combined cycle total can be improved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00072" lvl="0"><number>72.</number> Only reducing the mixing gas temperature introduced into the compressor may slightly improve the characteristic of the compressor as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> in a limited manner. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00073" lvl="0"><number>73.</number> Further, under a low partial load operation, the intake air is cooled so that the weight flow rate of the intake air introduced into the compressor <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is increased, resulting in the possibility of a increase of the load of the gas turbine to be driven under a low load. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00074" lvl="0"><number>74.</number> If the diameter of the sprayed liquid droplet is large, it collides with the vane or casing of the compressor <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> so that it is vaporized by receiving a heat from the metal. As a result, the temperature reduction effect of the operating liquid may be obstructed. Thus, the diameter of the liquid droplet is desired to be as small as possible from this viewpoint. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00075" lvl="0"><number>75.</number> The sprayed liquid droplet has a distribution of the diameters of the droplets. To prevent a collision of the droplets against the vane or casing of the compressor <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> or erosion of the vane, the diameter of the sprayed liquid droplets is controlled so as to be 50 &mgr;m or below. To minimize an effect on the vane, the maximum diameter thereof is desired to be 50 &mgr;m or below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00076" lvl="0"><number>76.</number> Because the smaller the diameter of the droplet, the more uniformly the liquid droplets can be distributed in flowing air, so that the distribution of the temperature in the compressor is suppressed, it is desirable that the Sautor average diameter (S.D.M.) is 30 &mgr;m or below. Because the liquid droplets ejected from an infection nozzle has a distribution of grain size, the aforementioned maximum diameter is difficult to be measured. Thus, for actual use, the measurement of the aforementioned Sautor average diameter (S.D.M.) is applied. Although the diameter of the droplet is desired to be as small as possible, an injection nozzle for producing a small droplet requires a high precision production technology. Thus, a lower limit allowing technically as small a droplet as possible is an  actual range of the aforementioned diameter thereof. Therefore, from such a viewpoint, for the aforementioned main droplet diameter, maximum diameter and average diameter, 1 &mgr;m is a lower limit. Further, the smaller the diameter of the droplets, the more energy is consumed for generating such droplets. Thus, considering the energy to be consumed for generation of the liquid droplets, it is permissible to determine the aforementioned lower limit. If the droplet size is a size allowing it to float in the atmosphere so that it is not likely to drop, generally, the condition of its contact surface is excellent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00077" lvl="0"><number>77.</number> A time in which the air passes through the compressor is very short. To vaporize the liquid droplets excellently in this while and intensify the vaporization efficiency, the Sautor average diameter (S.D.M.) is desired to be less than 30 &mgr;m. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00078" lvl="0"><number>78.</number> Because a high precision production art is required for production of an injection nozzle capable of generating small droplets, the lower limit technically allowing the droplet diameter to be reduced is the lower limit for the aforementioned grain size. For example, such lower limit is 1 &mgr;m. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00079" lvl="0"><number>79.</number> This is because if the droplet diameter is too large, the vaporization thereof in the compressor is made difficult. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00080" lvl="0"><number>80.</number> An introduction amount of the droplets can be adjusted depending on the temperature, humidity and an increase of the output. Taking into account an amount of the vaporization of the liquid droplets in an interval from a spraying point to the compressor intake, more than 2 wt % relative to the intake air weight flow rate can be introduced. Its upper limit is determined in a range capable of maintaining the function of the compressor in an excellent condition. For example, it is possible to determine the upper limit to be 5 wt % such that the introduction range is below this value. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00081" lvl="0"><number>81.</number> Although the introduction range can be adjusted considering summer season and dry condition, to further increase the output, it is possible to introduce at 0.8 wt % or more and 5 wt % or below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00082" lvl="0"><number>82.</number> It is permissible to additionally dispose the injection nozzle so as to spray the liquid droplets over compression gas. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00083" lvl="0"><number>83.</number> A position of the spray nozzle <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> will be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</cross-reference>.

The infection nozzle <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is disposed via a predetermined distance from the compressor exit. However, if a silencer is disposed within the suction duct <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>, it is disposed in the downstream relative thereto. As a result, if it is intended to not only attain high efficiency partial load operation but also achieve high efficiency increased output operation, favorably, a part of the liquid droplet is vaporized before it is introduced into tile compressor and aster it is introduced into the compressor, it is further vaporized during a flow in the compressor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00085" lvl="0"><number>85.</number> The spray nozzle <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is disposed on an introduction vane provided in the most upstream which is an introduction portion of the compressor, provided at the compressor intake. An air supplying path and water supplying path are disposed within the same vane. As a result, a resistance by the spray nozzle to the flow is suppressed and the liquid droplets can be sprayed without providing special space for installation of the nozzle. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00086" lvl="0"><number>86.</number> A spray nozzle <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight> is disposed between the aforementioned guide vane and IGV. This prevents the sprayed liquid droplets from being vaporized before entering the compressor and the weight flow rate of the mixing gas from increasing. From such a viewpoint, it is desirable to install the inject on nozzle near the IGV. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00087" lvl="0"><number>87.</number> By disposition of <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c</italic></highlight>, continuous vaporization within the compressor can be obtained. Further, by vaporizing as much as possible at a relatively upstream of the compressor, the compressor exhaust temperature can be reduced, so that a rise of the compressor exhaust temperature can be suppressed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00088" lvl="0"><number>88.</number> An injection nozzle <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>is disposed at the middle of the compressor. For fear of the symptom as stalling of the vane of the compressor is more likely to occur at the vane of the rear end, this injection nozzle may be installed at the middle stage of the compressor near the rear end. In this case, the nozzle is installed on a stationary vane as shown by an enlarged view and a water supplying means and air supplying means are provided within the vane. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00089" lvl="0"><number>89.</number> The sprayed liquid droplets flowing in the compressor move between the vanes of the compressor along its flow line. In the compressor, the intake air is heated by adiabatic compression, so that the liquid droplets are vaporized from the surface by this heat and while the diameter thereof is being reduced, transferred to the rear end vane. In this process, vaporization latent heat required for vaporization lowers the temperature of the mixing gas in the compressor because it depends on the mixing gas in the compressor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00090" lvl="0"><number>90.</number> The spray amount of the aforementioned injection nozzle <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is controlled so as to correspond to a recirculating amount of the combustion gas. For example, it is controlled so that the spray amount is larger when the recirculating amount is large than when the recirculating amount is small. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00091" lvl="0"><number>91.</number> At the time of the partial load operation of the gas turbine of the combined plant, the mixing gas composed of the gas turbine exhaust gas through the recirculating pipe <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and air supplied through the suction duct <highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight> is introduced to the compressor <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and in the compressor <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the aforementioned mixing gas is compressed and discharged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00092" lvl="0"><number>92.</number> With this condition, the aforementioned fine liquid droplets are sprayed from the aforementioned spray nozzle <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and introduced into the compressor, and during a flow in the compressor <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, the liquid droplets are vaporized. </paragraph>

<paragraph id="P-00094" lvl="0"><number>94.</number> It is possible to improve the characteristic of the compressor which has been lowered due to a rise of the compressor intake air temperature accompanied by an increase of the recirculation amount at the time of the partial load operation, particularly of low load operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00095" lvl="0"><number>95.</number> A control of the spray amount will be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00096" lvl="0"><number>96.</number> In this control, an output signal S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> which becomes larger as the load decreases in a function generator FG<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>  receiving the load request signal Ld and a combustion temperature signal estimated from gas turbine exhaust gas temperature and compressor output pressure in a function generator FG<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to correct a combustion temperature change in actual operation are applied to a subtracter AD<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and then a correction recirculation rate signal is output from the function generator FG<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. This signal is input to the function generator FG<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> in which a spray amount increases as a recirculation amount increases. An output signal S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> of water droplet spray amount relative to the recirculation amount is obtained. This signal S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>  and a next gas temperature of the compressor actually measured are applied to a subtractor AD<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and then a correction spray amount signal of the function generator FG<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>  is output. This signal is supplied to an adjustor P<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> to control a spray amount (supply water amount) adjusting valve <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>. By this control, the spray amount can be adjusted depending on the recirculation rate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00097" lvl="0"><number>97.</number> It is permissible to open the air flow adjusting valve <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> if required to produce fine droplets. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> indicates a control line of the spray rate relative to the recirculation rate assuming that the gas turbine exhaust temperature is constant. The spray rate increases substantially linearly relative to the recirculation rate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00098" lvl="0"><number>98.</number> Although the incidence of the vane in the compressor is changed by the recirculating operation as described before, it can be returned to a state before exhaust gas recirculation by control of the aforementioned control line. For example, at the atmospheric temperature of 15&deg; C., when the recirculation amount is 10% on exhaust gas weight flow basis, the spray amount (on outside air weight basis) is about 3% and when the recirculation amount is 20%, the spray amount is about 5.5%. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00099" lvl="0"><number>99.</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</cross-reference> indicates a relation between mixing gas intake temperature and recirculation rate relative to each load. The mixing gas (volumetric flow rate) sucked into the compressor <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is constant regardless of the load because the gas turbine <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is rotating at a constant speed. As the load drops, the gas turbine exhaust gas recirculation amount increases, so that correspondingly the compressor intake air temperature rises. On the contrary, if the recirculation amount increases so that the mixing gas intake temperature rises, the gas turbine output drops owing to the decrease of the compressor intake suction weight flow rate. In a plain recirculation gas turbine of the conventional art, if stalling or the like on the vane of the last stage is considered, the upper limit of the compressor intake air is 50&deg; C. and therefore the recirculation amount is restricted so that the gas turbine output reduction is also restricted. However, according to the present embodiment, spraying fine liquid droplets at the compressor intake so as to cool the compressor internal gas, liquid behavior in the vicinity of the compressor vane is improved. Thus, the gas turbine exhaust gas recirculation amount can be increased so that operation at a lower load is enabled and further a higher efficiency partial load operation is enabled. Although the temperature of the compression air coming out of the compressor <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is lowered due to the vaporization of water droplets in the compressor, the combustion temperature can be maintained at a constant level by increasing a fuel loading amount. Next, the combustion gas works in a process of its adiabatic expansion in the gas turbine <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. Because a part of the combustion gas is consumed for driving the compressor <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and generator <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, met output thereof corresponds to that difference. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00100" lvl="0"><number>100.</number> The part of the gas turbine exhaust gas from the gas turbine <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> recirculates through the recirculating means <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and control means (exhaust gas recirculation amount adjusting valve) <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> as a part of the intake air in the compressor <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>.  In the gas turbine exhaust heat recovery boiler <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>, high pressure steam is generated and this steam drives the steam turbine <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and generator <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> to generate power. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00101" lvl="0"><number>101.</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> shows a comparison of efficiency drop due to respective loads in the combined cycle with efficiency drop in ordinary combined cycle, exhaust gas recirculation type combined cycle and the present embodiment. Although as regards the cycle heat efficiency of the ordinary combined cycle, efficiency drop in a range up to 90% load in which combustion temperature constant operation is carried out is not so large, the combustion temperature drops at an operation having a less than 90% load. Therefore the efficiency drops rapidly, so that at the 25% load which is a load determined by a restriction on the bottoming side, the efficiency drops in terms of a relative value by about 40%. The combustion temperature constant operation by the aforementioned IGV or the like has a range slightly different depending on machine. However, in most cases, the efficiency drop is up to 80% even if it is small. Although in the gas turbine exhaust gas recirculation type combined cycle, its cycle heat efficiency drop is smaller than ordinary combined cycle, it cannot be operated at more than 65% load due to restriction of the compressor intake air temperature. On the contrary, according to the present invention, by cooling the internal gas in the compressor, the compressor driving power drops and its output increases, so that the heat efficiency is improved. As a result, the efficiency drop relative to each load is further reduced. Therefore, as compared to the gas turbine exhaust gas recirculation type combined cycle, a lower load operation is enabled and theoretically, the operation is enabled up to about 30% load in which oxygen concentration in the gas turbine exhaust gas is zero, The efficiency drop is about 10%. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00102" lvl="0"><number>102.</number> A lower limit is preferred to be determined depending on setting of the apparatus, and generally, it is considered that in most cases, the recirculation is carried out up to at least 50% load. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00103" lvl="0"><number>103.</number> Although <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference> considers operation by control by IGV or the like in a range in which combined cycle load is 100-90% or 80%, the present invention is not restricted to this example, it is permissible to control the recirculation amount correspondingly if the load descends from 100%. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00104" lvl="0"><number>104.</number> To increase the recirculation amount as the load decreases, assuming that the combustion temperature is 1430&deg; C. and the compressor exit temperature is 370&deg; C. in order to prevent the compressor exit temperature from exceeding 370&deg; C., the compressor intake temperature is 150&deg; C. when the combined cycle load is 74%, 112&deg; C. when 50% and 240&deg; C. when 30%. According to the present embodiment, by reducing the compressor exit temperature by introducing liquid droplets to be vaporized in the compressor, inconveniences which may occur at the rear end of the compressor can be avoided. Thus, by raising the recirculation rate by controlling the spray amount of the liquid droplets to be vaporized in the compressor, it is possible to control so that the temperature of the mixing gas at the compressor intake rises. Further, the recirculation amount can be increased as compared to a plain recirculation plant, so that the recirculation amount can be increased even in low partial load operation range. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00105" lvl="0"><number>105.</number> Further according to the present embodiment, in a combined plant load range of at least 50-80%, it is possible to control so that the aforementioned spray amount is increased as the recirculation amount is increased and that the recirculation amount is continuously increased as she load is decreased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00106" lvl="0"><number>106.</number> Further, by controlling the aforementioned recirculation amount corresponding to the load so as to suppress a deflection of the combustion temperature in the combustion chamber in a combined plant load range of at least 50%-80% (for example, controlling so that the recirculation amount is increased as the load is decreased) and introducing the liquid droplets into the compressor, it is possible to suppress a temperature rise of the compression air at the compressor exit. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00107" lvl="0"><number>107.</number> Following control can be carried out in the integrated control device <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>.  </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00108" lvl="0"><number>108.</number> The aforementioned recirculation amount and aforementioned liquid droplet spray amount are controlled corresponding to the load so as to suppress a deflection of the combustion temperature of the combustion chamber in a combined plant load range of 50%-80%. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00109" lvl="0"><number>109.</number> As the load decreases, the recirculation amount is increased and the spray amount is also increased so as to suppress a drop of the combustion temperature and keep it high. As a result, a high efficiency operation is enable in a wide range of the partial load. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00110" lvl="0"><number>110.</number> Further, to suppress a deflection of the combustion temperature of the combustion chamber in a combined cycle load range of 50%-80%, the aforementioned recirculation amount is controlled corresponding to the load and by introducing the liquid droplets into the compressor, a rise of the temperature of the compression air at the compressor exit is suppressed. Because the compressor exit temperature rises as the recirculation amount is increased, the liquid droplets are introduced into the compressor and vaporized therein so that that temperature is maintained in an allowable range. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00111" lvl="0"><number>111.</number> Further, the gas turbine exhaust gas amount to be returned to the compressor intake is adjusted corresponding to a change of the load in the aforementioned combined cycle and the aforementioned recirculation amount is controlled corresponding to the load to suppress a deflection of the combustion temperature of the combustion chamber in a combined plant load range of 50%-80% thereby controlling the aforementioned spray amount to be vaporized during a flow in the compressor. In this process, the recirculation amount is so controlled as to be continuously increased as the load lowers. Although if the recirculation amount is so controlled as to be increased as the load lowers, there is produced an upper limit in the increase amount of the recirculation amount for the reason of the compressor or the like, the introduction amount of the liquid droplets to be vaporized in the compressor is adjusted such that the introduction amount of the liquid droplets is increased as the load lowers. As a result, as the load lowers in a wide range of the partial load, the recirculation amount can be continuously increased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00112" lvl="0"><number>112.</number> Because the aforementioned upper limit is a upper limit load for carrying out the recirculation, if the recirculation is carried out when the load drops from 100%, the aforementioned upper limit range is expanded. Further, because the lower limit is determined depending on setting of the apparatus, it is possible to so control as to increase the recirculation amount in a wider range. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00113" lvl="0"><number>113.</number> A second embodiment will be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> and other diagrams. Its basic structure is the same as the first embodiment. Although the spray amount is controlled depending on the gas turbine exhaust gas recirculation amount in the first embodiment, according to the present embodiment, the spray amount control method differs in that the spray amount is controlled depending on a gas temperature measured at the compressor exit although the gas turbine exhaust gas recirculation amount control is the same as the first embodiment. Although the combined plant apparatus structure is the same as the first embodiment, a means for measuring a compressor exit gas temperature and inputting this signal into the integrated control device <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> has been added as a spray amount controlling means. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference> shows an integrated control device <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> of the present embodiment. According to the present embodiment, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</cross-reference>, a measured compressor exit gas temperature is input to the function generator FG<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> and then a spray amount is calculated so as to suppress a deflection of the compressor exit gas temperature before the gas turbine exhaust gas is recirculated or preferably so that the temperature is constant. It is so controlled so that the spray amount is increased as the exit temperature rises. By means of the adjuster IP<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> based on the obtained spray amount signal, the spray amount (supply water amount) adjusting valve <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is controlled. On the other hand, because the combustion temperature may be changed by spraying, the fuel flow rate of a case in which the liquid droplets are sprayed is correctively controlled by applying a spray amount signal to a fuel flow rate signal obtained from the load request signal Ld and actual load L, thereby achieving a constant combustion temperature. As an example, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> shows a control line for calculating a compressor exit gas temperature before the gas turbine exhaust gas recirculation from a compressor exit gas temperature when the atmospheric temperature is 15&deg; C. Although the compressor exit gas temperature is about 450&deg; C. when the gas turbine exhaust gas recirculation amount is 10%, by carrying out about 2.5% spray at the compressor intake, the compressor exit gas temperature constant operation before carrying out the gas turbine exhaust gas recirculation is made possible. Further because the compressor exit gas temperature is changed depending on a change of the atmospheric temperature even if the gas turbine exhaust gas recirculation amount is constant, it is desirable that the control line contains the atmospheric temperature as a parameter. Thus, an operation not following a minute change of the output or change in the temperature is enabled, so that the operation control is facilitated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00114" lvl="0"><number>114.</number> Because a temperature of the rear end of the compressor which is a cause for inconvenience of compression is directly reflected, a higher precision operation is enabled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00115" lvl="0"><number>115.</number> A third embodiment will be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> and other diagrams. Its basic structure is the same as the structure of the first embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00116" lvl="0"><number>116.</number> A feature of the present embodiment exists in that a detection unit for detecting a mixing gas temperature at the compressor intake is provided and the spray amount is controlled depending on a temperature provided by that temperature detection unit.  </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00117" lvl="0"><number>117.</number> For example, it is so controlled that when the temperature of the mixing gas entering the compressor is high rather than low, more liquid droplets are sprayed by the integrated control device S. Further, the spray amount is controlled so as to obtain the compressor exit temperature before exhaust gas recirculation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00118" lvl="0"><number>118.</number> As a result, even at a low partial load operation time, high efficiency operation is enabled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00119" lvl="0"><number>119.</number> A fourth embodiment will be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> and other diagrams. Its basic structure is the same as that of the first embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00120" lvl="0"><number>120.</number> A feature of the present embodiment exists in that the spray amount is controlled by the integrated control device <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> according to a signal from a combined cycle plant load measuring apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00121" lvl="0"><number>121.</number> For example, it is so controlled that more liquid droplets are sprayed when the load is low rather than high. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00122" lvl="0"><number>122.</number> As a result, at a low partial load operation time, a high efficiency operation is enabled. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00123" lvl="0"><number>123.</number> The load is often measured on regular operation as well and can be controlled easily because such a signal is available. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00124" lvl="0"><number>124.</number> A fifth embodiment will be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> and other diagrams. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00125" lvl="0"><number>125.</number> Its basic structure is the same that of the first embodiment. A point of the present embodiment is a gas turbine apparatus not provided with a exhaust heat recovery boiler <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> supplied with exhaust gas from the gas turbine <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>  and a steam turbine supplied with steam generated in the gas turbine exhaust heat recovery boiler <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>.  </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00126" lvl="0"><number>126.</number> As described in the aforementioned first embodiments, there is provided a spray unit for introducing liquid droplets in the compressor in which the mixing gas comprising gas turbine exhaust gas passing through the aforementioned recirculation path and air flows so as to vaporize the introduced liquid droplets during a flow in the compressor. As a result, the amount of the gas turbine exhaust gas to be returned to the compressor is adjusted corresponding to the load change of the aforementioned combined cycle plant. The liquid droplets are sprayed from the spray unit into the compressor in which the mixing gas comprising gas turbine exhaust gas passing through the aforementioned recirculation path and air flows so as to vaporize the introduced liquid droplets during a flow in the compressor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00127" lvl="0"><number>127.</number> Additionally, a spray amount control unit for controlling a spray amount corresponding to the aforementioned recirculation amount is also provided. Corresponding to the load on the combined cycle plant, it is so controlled as to spray more when the load is low rather than high. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00128" lvl="0"><number>128.</number> Further, the spray amount is controlled corresponding to a change of the temperature of the mixing gas to be introduced to a compressor intake. The spray amount is so controlled as to be more when the mixing gas temperature is high rather than low. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00129" lvl="0"><number>129.</number> As a result, as described above, the temperature of the internal gas in the compressor can be reduced so that the characteristic of the compressor can be improved. Thus, the gas turbine exhaust gas recirculation amount can be increased so that the partial load operation range can be expanded. Further, by an effect of water droplet spray into compressor intake air, the heat efficiency can be improved higher than the gas turbine exhaust gas recirculation type gas turbine apparatus. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00130" lvl="0"><number>130.</number> A sixth embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. In the sixth embodiment, the spray amount and recirculation amount are controlled depending on a temperature of exhaust gas to be introduced to the compressor. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00131" lvl="0"><number>131.</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> shows a schematic view of this embodiment. Basically, this is of the same structure as the schematic view of the first embodiment. In this embodiment, recirculating exhaust gas is introduced from a downstream side of the gas turbine exhaust heat recovery boiler <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight>.  </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00132" lvl="0"><number>132.</number> Although the pipe <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> for fetching out a part of exhaust gas of the gas turbine <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> may be provided at any place of the gas turbine exhaust heat recovery boiler, exhaust heat recovery boiler intake portion and outlet portion, it should be provided at the gas turbine exhaust heat recovery boiler outlet portion like this embodiment so as to make effective use of heat in the gas turbine exhaust gas. The operation ends include a fuel amount control valve <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> for controlling the fuel amount to be charged on the combustion chamber <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>,  a recirculation amount control means <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>, a spray amount adjusting valve <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and air flow amount adjusting valve <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>  and these operation ends are controlled depending on an operation signal dispatched from an integrated control unit <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight>. Such an operation enables to control the power generation efficiency of the combined plant. A signal of a temperature detection unit <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> for detecting the temperature of air to be supplied to the compressor is transmitted to the integrated control unit. Preferably, a signal of the humidity detection unit <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> is transmitted. The temperature detection unit <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and humidity detection unit <highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> can be provided at a converging portion of the recirculation exhaust gas or in the upstream of the spray nozzle <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The entire plant is controlled by an instruction from the integrated control unit <highlight><bold>8</bold></highlight> so as to control the recirculation amount, fuel amount, air amount and water spray amount appropriately. For example, a compressor intake temperature is inputted to raise plant efficiency so that the plant load is controlled so as to be constant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00133" lvl="0"><number>133.</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> shows an example of the control mechanism of the integrated control unit. First, a difference between a load request signal Ld and actual load L is obtained by a subtractor AD<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and then a fuel amount object signal Fd is obtained by an adjuster PI<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. Next, a difference between the fuel amount object signal Fd and actual fuel amount F is obtained by the subtractor AD<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and a fuel amount control valve <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight> is adjusted by an adjuster PI<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> so as to determine an amount of fuel to be charged on the combustion chamber. The fuel amount can be controlled in this manner. For example, this control is capable of increasing the amount of fuel to be charged on the combustion chamber <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> as the load increases. According to a compressor intake temperature, preferably additionally a compressor intake humidity, an instruction signal S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> on the recirculation amount is dispatched by a function generator <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> (FG<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>). This signal is supplied to an adjuster P<highlight><bold>13</bold></highlight> so as to control the recirculation control means <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. Further the function generator <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> (FG<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>) generates an instruction signal S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> on the spray amount from a spray nozzle <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. This signal is supplied to an adjuster P<highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and controls a supply water amount adjusting valve <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and an air flow adjusting valve <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight> so as to control a spray amount of droplet from the spray nozzle <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. It is favorable to estimate a combustion temperature from the gas turbine exhaust gas temperature and compressor outlet pressure by means of a function generator <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> (FG<highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight>) and apply this value to the subtractor AD<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> to carry out corrective control of the fuel amount. When a change occurs in the compressor intake temperature or external air temperature, the fuel is adjusted corresponding to that change thereby suppressing a change in combustion temperature so as to make the combustion temperature constant. Although keeping the combustion temperature constant is important to realize a high efficient plant operation, there is a possibility that the combustion temperature may change in actual operation. Therefore, if the change in the combustion temperature is controlled based on an actual combustion temperature estimated from the actual exhaust gas temperature of a gas turbine and compressor discharge pressure, it is possible to carry out the operation while suppressing a drop of the combustion temperature at the time of water spray or recirculation. This prevents a drop of efficiency due to a decrease of the fuel temperature. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00134" lvl="0"><number>134.</number> Further, it is desirable to obtain a difference between the load request signal Ld and actual load L by the subtractor AD<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and correct an output of the function generator <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. This contributes to making the load constant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00135" lvl="0"><number>135.</number> It is desirable to realize an optimum plant efficient operation based on the output of the function generator <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>.   </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00136" lvl="0"><number>136.</number> Because the plant efficiency may change in actual operation, it is desirable to calculate a difference between a requested plant efficiency &eegr;d and actual plant efficiency &eegr; by means of the subtractor AD<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> and apply an output of the subtractor AD<highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> to the subtractors AD<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>, AD<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> so as to correct an output of the function generator <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>. As a result, a high efficiency operation can be achieved even in actual operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00137" lvl="0"><number>137.</number> The function generator <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> calculates a combustion temperature according to a signal from the gas turbine exhaust gas temperature detector <highlight><bold>24</bold></highlight> and a signal from a compressor discharged air temperature detector <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> and dispatches a signal to the AD<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>. For example, it is possible to calculate so that the combustion temperature is higher when the gas turbine exhaust gas temperature is high than when it is low or the same when the compressor discharge pressure is high than when it is low. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00138" lvl="0"><number>138.</number> A numeral value corresponding to the combustion temperature can be outputted by other means. The function generator <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> controls a spray amount of a spray nozzle <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>  based on a compressor intake temperature. Further, it controls the recirculation amount. The spray amount and the like is preferred to be corrected based on the compressor intake humidity. The spray amount (or a limit value of the spray amount) increases as the temperature rises, so that the spray amount (or a limit value of the spray amount) cam be adjusted so as to be larger when the humidity is low than when it is high. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00139" lvl="0"><number>139.</number> When a detected temperature of air supplied to the compressor is in a set first temperature region, the recirculation is carried out and the spray of droplets from the spray unit is stopped. If the detected temperature is in a second temperature region which is higher than the first temperature region, the recirculation is stopped and the spray of the droplets from the spray unit is stopped. If the detected temperature is in a third temperature region which is higher than the second temperature region, the recirculation is stopped and the spray unit is controlled to spray the droplets. It is desirable to set a upper limit and lower limit of a region in which a high combined plant efficiency is ensured, so that they are set to a change temperature between the first temperature region and second temperature region and a change temperature between the second temperature region and third temperature region. It is desirable to set the aforementioned respective temperatures from a range between 15&deg; C. and 22&deg; C. which ensures a high combined plant efficiency. If some plant deviates from this region, it is desirable to set these values depending on the plant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00140" lvl="0"><number>140.</number> By monitoring the compressor intake temperature, the recirculation amount and water spray amount are controlled so as to reach such a compressor intake temperature allowing the plant efficiency to be maximized and realize a constant load on the plant at all times. In the case of the first temperature region, for example, if the compressor intake temperature is lower than an intake air temperature region allowing the plant efficiency to be high, the function generator FG<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> to which the compressor intake temperature is to be inputted is requested to dispatch a signal S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> which increases the recirculation rate as the intake temperature decreases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00141" lvl="0"><number>141.</number> This signal S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> is supplied to the adjuster PI<highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> so as to control the recirculation control means <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The signal S<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> controls the recirculation amount to a desired output and can be used as a limit value of the recirculation amount. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00142" lvl="0"><number>142.</number> In the case of the second temperature region, the recirculation and the spray of droplets from the spray nozzle <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> are stopped. In the case of the third temperature region, for example if the compressor intake temperature is higher than the intake air temperature which allows the plant efficiency to be high, the function generator PG<highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> to which the compressor intake temperature and humidity are to be inputted is requested to dispatch a signal S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> which increases the spray rate as the intake air temperature rises or the relative humidity lowers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00143" lvl="0"><number>143.</number> This signal S<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is supplied to the adjuster PI<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> so as to control the water supply amount adjusting valve <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> and air flow amount adjusting valve <highlight><bold>15</bold></highlight>.  </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00144" lvl="0"><number>144.</number> As a result, even if the external air temperature changes, the compressor intake temperature can be kept constant by the recirculation amount control and spray amount control or the change can be suppressed excellently. Thus, even if the atmospheric temperature changes, the combined plant can be operated at a high plant efficiency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00145" lvl="0"><number>145.</number> Because the first temperature region and third temperature region are provided through the second temperature region, if the atmospheric temperature changes, the control in the second temperature region in which the combined plant efficiency is high can be facilitated. Despite a change in the atmospheric temperature, a desired output can be obtained at a high efficiency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00146" lvl="0"><number>146.</number> Consequently, a high reliability plant unlikely to be affected by a temperature change can be constructed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00147" lvl="0"><number>147.</number> As the case may be, it is possible to narrow the aforementioned second temperature region and set it to a certain temperature. Such a case is favorable for realizing a high efficiency operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00148" lvl="0"><number>148.</number> Because the gas turbine exhaust gas recirculation and water droplet spray are switched over across an atmospheric temperature producing a high plant efficiency, the plant control is facilitated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00149" lvl="0"><number>149.</number> The high efficiency operation will be described. The plant efficiency is determined by the plant output (gas turbine output and steam turbine output) and fuel flow rate. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00150" lvl="0"><number>150.</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> shows an efficiency characteristic depending on the atmospheric temperature. If the atmospheric temperature drops below an atmospheric temperature allowing the plant efficiency to be maximized, the compressor intake weight flow rate increases. On the other hand, because the combustion temperature is constant, the fuel flow rate increases so what the gas turbine output also increases. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00151" lvl="0"><number>151.</number> Although the steam cycle is influenced by an increase of the gas turbine exhaust gas flow rate accompanied by an increase of the compressor intake weight flow rate and a drop of the gas turbine exhaust gas temperature due to a drop of the atmospheric temperature, the steam turbine output is increased because the influence by the gas turbine exhaust gas flow rate is large. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00152" lvl="0"><number>152.</number> However because the increase rate of the steam turbine output is smaller that that of the gas turbine output, the increase rate of the plant output is small so that the plant efficiency is also small. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00153" lvl="0"><number>153.</number> On the other hand, if the atmospheric temperature rises over an atmospheric temperature under which the plant efficiency is maximized, the fuel flow rate decreases with a decrease of the compressor intake weight flow rate, so that the gas turbine output and steam turbine output drop. Particularly because the gas turbine output drop is large, the plant efficiency is reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00154" lvl="0"><number>154.</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</cross-reference> shows a relation between the atmospheric temperature and plant output. The plant output changes depending on the atmospheric temperature and as the atmospheric temperature lowers, the plant output increases as shown by broken line. However, in actual power generation plants, each approved output is specified and therefore it is considered that an operation exceeding that limit is not carried out. Therefore, is the approved output is reached, the approved output constant operation is continued irrespective of the atmospheric temperature as shown by a solid line and at this time, the gas turbine is operated with a partial load. If the atmospheric temperature rises, the gas turbine compressor intake weight flow rate and fuel flow rate are reduced so that the plant output drops. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00155" lvl="0"><number>155.</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference> shows a plant efficiency characteristic depending on the atmospheric temperature. In the aforementioned combined plant, if the approved output constant operation is carried out, the gas turbine is operated with its partial load, and therefore the plant efficiency is reduced extremely. However, by this embodiment, the gas turbine intake temperature can be the same as the atmospheric temperature allowing a high plant efficiency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00156" lvl="0"><number>156.</number> For example, with the recirculation rate of 0-40% with respect to the gas turbine exhaust gas flow rate, the plant efficiency can be improved by about 0-1.5% in terms of its relative value. If the compressor intake temperature is higher than the atmospheric temperature in which the plant efficiency is high, the plant efficiency can be improved by about 0.1% in terms of the relative value by a spray amount 0-0.2% the gas turbine intake flow rate by spraying droplets from the water spray nozzle <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> to gas turbine intake air. Therefore, if the atmospheric temperature is low, by returning a part of the gas turbine exhaust gas to the compressor intake by the gas turbine exhaust gas recirculation system, the compressor intake weight flow rate can be reduced so as to reduce the plant output. Therefore, the gas turbine can be operated at the approved output constant rating without being operated with its partial load. Further, if the atmospheric temperature is high, the plant output can be increased by increasing the compressor intake weight flow rate by the intake air water spray system, so that the constant loaded operation can be achieved at a high efficiency without depending on the atmospheric temperature. The seventh embodiment will be described with reference to FIGS. <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>.  </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00157" lvl="0"><number>157.</number> Basically, the seventh embodiment is capable of having the same structure as the sixth embodiment except that: If the detected temperature of air supplied to the compressor is in the first temperature region under control of the sixth embodiment, the aforementioned recirculation is carried out and the spray of droplets from the spray unit is stopped. If the detected temperature is in the second temperature region which is higher than the first temperature region, the aforementioned recirculation is carried out and the spray unit is controlled to spray droplets. If the detected temperature is in the third temperature region which is higher than the second temperature region, the aforementioned recirculation is stopped and the spray unit is controlled to spray droplets. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00158" lvl="0"><number>158.</number> The change temperature between the first temperature region and second temperature region, and the change temperature between the second temperature region and third temperature region can be set in the same way as in the sixth embodiment. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> shows an example of the control line. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00159" lvl="0"><number>159.</number> First, in the first temperature region (for example, in a case when the compressor intake temperature is lower than such a compressor intake temperature in which the plant efficiency is maximized), it is so controlled that the recirculation amount increases as the compressor intake temperature lowers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00160" lvl="0"><number>160.</number> In the second temperature region (for example, in such a temperature region in which the compressor intake temperature includes a compressor intake temperature allowing the plant efficiency to be maximized), the gas turbine exhaust gas is recirculated and the aforementioned droplet spray from the water spray nozzle <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is carried out. In this embodiment, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</cross-reference> shows a case in which the second temperature region is more than 19&deg; C. and less than 25&deg; C. Preferably, the second temperature region is divided to a high temperature side and a low temperature side relative to the set value. The set value is preferred to be determined with respect to such a value in which the combined plant efficiency is high. For example, it can be set in a range of 15&deg; C.-22&deg; C. Further the second temperature region can be set by providing the set value with an allowance of &plusmn;2&deg; C.-&plusmn;3&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00161" lvl="0"><number>161.</number> The aforementioned second temperature region should be set to a region in which the plant can be operated with stability. Concretely, the compressor intake temperature allowance may be about 5&deg; C. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00162" lvl="0"><number>162.</number> In the aforementioned low temperature region, the recirculation amount is kept constant and the intake air water spray system is started. The spray amount (or a limit value of the spray amount) or droplets from the water spray nozzle is preferred to be set so as to larger when the temperature is higher. The spray amount can be controlled to such a compressor intake temperature in which a plant efficiency is increased when the load on the plant is kept constant. It is possible to so control that the recirculation amount is kept constant until the compressor intake temperature reaches a compressor intake temperature in which the plant efficiency is maximized and the spray amount increases as the compressor intake temperature rises. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00163" lvl="0"><number>163.</number> In the high temperature region, it is favorable to so control that with the spray amount kept constant, the recirculation amount is decreased when the temperature of air to be supplied to the compressor is high as compared to when it is low. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00164" lvl="0"><number>164.</number> In the third temperature region (for example, in a case when the compressor intake temperature is higher than a compressor intake temperature in which the plant efficiency is maximized), the recirculation of the gas turbine exhaust gas is stopped and water is sprayed from the water spray nozzle <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. For example, it can be so controlled that the spray amount increases as the compressor intake temperature rises. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00165" lvl="0"><number>165.</number> As a result, even if the external air temperature changes, high efficiency constant operation can be achieved. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00166" lvl="0"><number>166.</number> Because there is provided a region in which the recirculation of the gas turbine exhaust gas and spray of droplets from the water spray nozzle <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> are carried out even when the external air temperature changes, the changeover in the second temperature region can be executed smoothly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00167" lvl="0"><number>167.</number> Further, it is possible to suppress changes in the efficiency of the plant and output thereof in a temperature region in which the plant efficiency is high. That is, it is possible to suppress a deviation from a desired output by preventing the output change while achieving smooth droplet spray and recirculation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00168" lvl="0"><number>168.</number> By forming such a temperature region in which the spray of droplets and recirculation of the gas turbine exhaust gas are executed in the aforementioned second temperature region or a region in which the water spray from the water spray nozzle <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> and changeover of the recirculation of the gas turbine exhaust gas are carried out, even if the external air temperature changes suddenly, the high efficiency operation can be continued responding quickly to this. Further, this embodiment is capable of largely contributing to an operation ensuring a high efficiency and suppressing a change in load (preferably, constant load operation) even if the external air temperature changes. Particularly, it is possible to easily suppress a change in the spray amount due to a change in the external air temperature and a output change due to a change in the recirculation amount. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00169" lvl="0"><number>169.</number> An eighth embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00170" lvl="0"><number>170.</number> The eighth embodiment includes a carbon dioxide gas condensing mechanism for condensing carbon dioxide so as to reduce carbon dioxide (e.g., CO<highlight><subscript>2</subscript></highlight>) in the gas turbine exhaust gas and a carbon dioxide gas removing unit <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> for reducing the concentration of carbon dioxide contained in the gas turbine exhaust gas, which contains the condensed carbon dioxide gas. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00171" lvl="0"><number>171.</number> In the gas turbine exhaust gas recirculation plant, by returning the gas turbine exhaust gas to the intake of the gas turbine so as to achieve recirculation in the gas turbine cycle, the concentration of carbon dioxide gas becomes higher than the conventional plant. As the recirculation amount increases, the concentration of the carbon dioxide in the gas turbine exhaust gas becomes higher. As a result, the carbon dioxide removing efficiency also rises. When the concentration of oxygen in the gas turbine exhaust gas becomes zero, namely the gas turbine exhaust gas recirculation rate is 75%, the concentration of carbon dioxide in the gas turbine exhaust gas becomes about four times as compared to the conventional plant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00172" lvl="0"><number>172.</number> Because the performance of the carbon dioxide gas removing unit is parallel to the concentration of carbon dioxide gas, volumetric flow rate and transfer area, if the concentration of carbon dioxide becomes four times while the performance of the carbon dioxide gas removing unit is the same, the transfer area can be reduced by &frac14;.  </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00173" lvl="0"><number>173.</number> For the reason, the carbon dioxide gas can be reduced by introducing the gas turbine exhaust gas containing the condensed carbon dioxide gas to the carbon dioxide gas removing unit <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>. Therefore, as compared to a case when the carbon dioxide gas removing unit is only installed in the gas turbine plant, the carbon dioxide can be removed at a high efficiency. Further, if the same removing performance as the carbon dioxide gas removing unit of the conventional plant is ensured, the size of the carbon dioxide gas removing unit can he reduced. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00174" lvl="0"><number>174.</number> Therefore, because the size of the carbon dioxide gas removing unit to be installed on the flow path of the gas turbine exhaust gas can be reduced, the pressure loss can be suppressed thereby contributing to a high efficiency operation of the gas turbine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00175" lvl="0"><number>175.</number> Additionally, in the carbon dioxide gas condensing mechanism, the gas turbine exhaust gas is recirculated so as to run the gas turbine according to this embodiment, carbon dioxide gas of a high concentration is generated and the gas turbine exhaust gas of a high concentration is introduced to the carbon dioxide gas removing unit. As a result, the gas turbine can be operated at a higher efficiency. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00176" lvl="0"><number>176.</number> Because the carbon dioxide can be removed at a high efficiency while achieving a high efficiency operation of the gas turbine, there is such a basic effect as forming a gas turbine or combined plant taking care of the environment and gentle to the environment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00177" lvl="0"><number>177.</number> The spray nozzle <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is preferred to be run as described in the aforementioned embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00178" lvl="0"><number>178.</number> Basically the eighth embodiment can possess a structure of the sixth embodiment. The eighth embodiment contains a carbon dioxide gas removing unit <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>which is provided on an exhaust gas path <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight> as well as the structure of the sixth embodiment. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00179" lvl="0"><number>179.</number> The gas turbine exhaust gas emitted from the gas turbine <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> supplied to the upstream of the compressor <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>  through a recirculating means <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. Mixing gas comprising air and recirculated exhaust gas is introduced to the compressor <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> so as to raise the pressure. The mixing gas discharged from the compressor <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and fuel are introduced to the gas turbine chamber <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and burnt together. As a result, gas turbine exhaust gas having a higher concentration of carbon dioxide than a plain gas turbine having no recirculating means is discharged from the gas turbine chamber <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> so as to drive the gas turbine <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. A part of the gas turbine exhaust gas having a high concentration of carbon dioxide is diverged to the recirculating means <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and the remainder thereof is introduced to the carbon dioxide gas removing unit <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>installed on the gas turbine exhaust gas path <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>  in the downstream of the diverging portion so that the concentration of the carbon dioxide is reduced. After the concentration of the carbon dioxide is reduced, the gas turbine exhaust gas is emitted to the air through a stack or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00180" lvl="0"><number>180.</number> As a result, in addition to the aforementioned basic effect, as compared to a case in which the carbon dioxide gas removing unit <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> of the present invention is installed on the gas turbine exhaust gas path <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> or recirculation means <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> between the gas turbine and the diverging portion of the recirculating means <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, the carbon dioxide concentration of the gas turbine exhaust gas to be supplied to the carbon dioxide gas removing unit <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> can be maintained at a high level. Thus, the carbon dioxide can be removed at a high efficiency. Further, in a case when not so a high efficiency is required, the size of the carbon dioxide gas removing unit <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> can be reduced while ensuring a desired performance. Due to the reduced size, the pressure loss in the gas turbine exhaust gas path can be reduced, thereby contributing to a high efficiency operation of the gas turbine. Further, because an amount of the gas turbine exhaust gas to be diverged by the recirculating means <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and emitted to the air is introduced to the carbon dioxide gas removing unit <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, that amount can be smaller than otherwise thereby the pressure loss being suppressed from this point of view, contributing to a high efficiency operation of the gas turbine. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00181" lvl="0"><number>181.</number> Even in a case when the recirculation amount is controlled to be deflected, the control of carbon dioxide to be emitted to the air is facilitated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00182" lvl="0"><number>182.</number> To remove the carbon dioxide gas at a high efficiency while achieving a highly stabilized recirculating operation, it is preferable that the recirculation amount is lower than 75% the flow rate of the gas turbine exhaust gas. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00183" lvl="0"><number>183.</number> As the carbon dioxide gas removing unit <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight>, it is possible to use one having a carbon dioxide gas removing performance capable of reducing the concentration of carbon dioxide to be supplied to the carbon dioxide gas removing unit by 5%-10%. For example, the carbon dioxide gas removing unit may be one using amine base absorptive agent. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00184" lvl="0"><number>184.</number> In a case when the gas turbine exhaust heat recovery boiler <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is disposed in the downstream of the diverging portion of the recirculating means <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>, the carbon dioxide gas removing unit is preferred to be located in the downstream of the gas turbine exhaust heat recovery boiler from viewpoints of a more compact structure, material strength and the like. This unit may be disposed within the gas turbine exhaust heat recovery boiler from viewpoints of simplification of the apparatus on the gas turbine exhaust gas path. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00185" lvl="0"><number>185.</number> A ninth embodiment will he described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00186" lvl="0"><number>186.</number> Basically, the ninth embodiment can employ a structure of the eighth embodiment. According to the ninth embodiment, instead of the carbon dioxide gas removing unit <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the eighth embodiment, a carbon dioxide gas removing unit <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is installed on the gas turbine exhaust gas path <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> between the gas turbine and the diverging portion to the recirculating means <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>.  </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00187" lvl="0"><number>187.</number> The gas turbine exhaust gas emitted from the gas turbine <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is supplied to the compressor <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> through the recirculating means <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. Mixing gas comprising air and recirculated exhaust gas is introduced to the compressor <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>  so as to raise the pressure. The mixing gas discharged from  the compressor <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and fuel are introduced to the gas turbine chamber <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and burnt together. As a result, gas turbine exhaust gas having a higher concentration of carbon dioxide than a plain gas turbine having no recirculating means is discharged from the gas turbine chamber <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> so as to drive the gas turbine <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. The gas turbine exhaust gas having a high concentration of carbon dioxide is introduced to the carbon dioxide gas removing unit <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>so as to reduce the concentration of the carbon dioxide gas. A part of the gas turbine exhaust gas in which the concentration of carbon dioxide is reduced is diverged to the recirculating means <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and the remainder is emitted to the air through a stack or the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00188" lvl="0"><number>188.</number> In addition to the basic effect of the aforementioned eighth embodiment, as compared to a case when the carbon dioxide gas removing means <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> is installed on the recirculating means or exhaust gas path <highlight><bold>31</bold></highlight>, a larger amount of higher concentration carbon dioxide gas can be supplied to the carbon dioxide gas removing unit <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>. Therefore, the carbon dioxide gas capture rate per unit area of the carbon dioxide gas removing unit <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>is increased, so that the carbon dioxide gas removing efficiency can be improved. If not so high an efficiency is demanded, the size of the carbon dioxide gas removing unit <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> can be reduced while ensuring a desired performance. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00189" lvl="0"><number>189.</number> A tenth embodiment will be described with reference to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00190" lvl="0"><number>190.</number> Basically, the tenth embodiment can employ a structure of the eighth embodiment. According to the tenth embodiment, instead of the carbon dioxide gas removing unit <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the eighth embodiment, a carbon dioxide gas removing unit <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>is installed as the recirculating means <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>.  </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00191" lvl="0"><number>191.</number> The gas turbine exhaust gas emitted from the gas turbine <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> is supplied to the upstream of the compressor <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>   through a recirculating means <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>. Mixing gas comprising air and recirculated exhaust gas is introduced to the compressor <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> so as to raise the pressure. The mixing gas discharged from the compressor <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> and fuel are introduced to the gas turbine chamber <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> and burnt together. As a result, gas turbine exhaust gas having a higher concentration of carbon dioxide than a plain gas turbine having no recirculating means is discharged from the gas turbine chamber <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> so as to drive the gas turbine <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight>. A part of the gas turbine exhaust gas having a high concentration of carbon dioxide is diverged to the recirculating means <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> and the remainder thereof is emitted to the air through a stack or the like. The diverged exhaust gas to the recirculating means <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight> is introduced to the carbon dioxide gas removing unit <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, in which the concentration of the carbon dioxide is reduced. After the concentration of the carbon dioxide is reduced, the gas turbine exhaust gas is supplied to the compressor <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> again. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00192" lvl="0"><number>192.</number> As described above, in addition to the basic effect so the eighth embodiment, it is unnecessary to install the carbon dioxide gas removing unit <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight> producing a pressure loss in a path for discharging the gas turbine exhaust gas to the air, thereby contributing to a high efficiency operation of the gas turbine. Further, the carbon dioxide gas removing unit <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>can be installed easily as well as when it is additionally installed on an existing gas turbine plant. Further, because the carbon dioxide gas removing unit <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>is installed separately from a system in which the gas turbine exhaust gas always flows, in the gas turbine plant using the recirculating means if necessary, the maintenance thereof is facilitated. Even in a case when the maintenance work on the carbon dioxide gas removing unit <highlight><bold>41</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight> is carried out, it is possible to carry out the maintenance work with the gas turbine operation being continued by shutting down the gas turbine exhaust gas flowing into the recirculating line. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00193" lvl="0"><number>193.</number> According to the present invention, it is possible to provide an exhaust gas recirculation type gas turbine apparatus having a wide partial load operation range, which can be efficiently operated. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-00194" lvl="0"><number>194.</number> It is further understood by those skilled in the art that the foregoing description is a preferred embodiment of the disclosed device and that various changes and modifications may be made in the invention without departing from the spirit and scope thereof. </paragraph>

<claim-text><highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. A running method of an exhaust gas recirculation type turbine apparatus comprising the steps of:   
<claim-text>compressing air by a compressor;   </claim-text>
<claim-text>burning the compressed air and fuel in a combustion chamber;   </claim-text>
<claim-text>driving a gas turbine by gas turbine exhaust gas from said combustion chamber;   </claim-text>
<claim-text>recirculating a part of said exhaust gas to an intake of said compressor through a recirculation path;   </claim-text>
<claim-text>spraying liquid droplets from a spray unit to introduce the liquid droplets into the compressor in which mixing gas comprising gas turbine exhaust gas and air flows through said recirculation path so as to vaporize the introduced liquid droplet during a flow in said compressor;   </claim-text>
<claim-text>detecting a temperature of air supplied to the compressor;   </claim-text>
<claim-text>and controlling so that in the case of a first temperature region in which said detected temperature is set, said recirculation is executed and said spray is stopped, in the case of a second temperature region which is higher than said first temperature region, said recirculation as stopped and said spray is stopped and in the case of a third temperature region which is higher than said second temperature region, said recirculation is stopped and said spray is executed. </claim-text>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention is directed to a machine for smoothing a turfed area to remove undulations. More specifically, the present invention is related to a turfplaner which comprises hydraulically activated levelers and a laser level guidance system. Even more specifically, the present invention is related to an improved gimbal for attachment of an implement to a three-point hitch of a tractor with a preferred implement including a turfplaner.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">There are many environments wherein a level grass surface is of utmost importance. By way of example, without limit thereto, are airplane runways, golf courses, sports fields and the like. Leveling a large area has never been an exact science. The most common technique is to utilize a box blade, also referred to as a landscaping box, which has a forward cutting blade and a rearward drag blade. The forward cutting blade gathers materials from high spots and drags the material along while riding on the rearward drag blade. The material from the high spots is deposited in the low spots thereby decreasing undulations. One disadvantage with a box blade is that the variation from gravitational planarity is mostly a function of the tractor used to pull the box blade. It is difficult to change the general contour with a box blade and doing so generally requires many passes.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A particular advantage of smooth turf is a decrease in injuries to users of the turf. This is particularly true with athletes, or horses, wherein injury can occur if uneven turf is encountered. Yet another problem with fine turf areas is weed growth. Weed killers, pre-emergent chemicals and the like have lost favor due to the perceived problems of run-off and unintended deposition.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Implements, such as a turfplaner, for use behind a tow vehicle, such as a tractor, can be mounted such that the movement is uncorrelated to the tow vehicle or it can be correlated to the tow vehicle. With a conventional three-point hitch, for example, any movement of the tractor perpendicular to the direction of travel will translate into a similar movement in the implement. With some implements this may be desirable but with many, such as a turfplaner, it is highly undesirable. There has been a long standing need for a mount which can be used with a three-point hitch which un-correlates the movement of the implement perpendicular to the direction of travel from the movement of the tractor perpendicular to the direction of travel.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Tractors, and particularly the standard three-point hitch of a tractor, are particularly desirable tow vehicles. The standard three-point hitch has the advantage of being able to vertically lift an implement by, typically, hydraulic power. Tractors are also typically available at locations where a turf planer is likely to be used which decreases the requirement that a tractor be transported to every site of operation. Unfortunately, standard three point hitches do not allow the implement to rotate on the axis of the direction of travel. This is normally a desired feature since it important in many instances to lift an implement without rotation. With some implements, such as a turf planer the implement needs to have rotational freedom relative to the tow vehicle yet the lift features associated with a three point hitch may still be desirable for transport and the like. There is currently no suitable connection between a standard three point hitch and an implement which allows for rotational freedom during operation with selective and reversible fixing, eliminating or restricting the rotation for transport. A gimbal is provided herein which provides these necessary functions.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0064" num="0068">The present invention is directed to an improved attachment of an implement, particularly a turfplaner, to a tow vehicle. More specifically, the present invention is related to an improved gimbal for attachment of an implement, such as a turfplaner, to a three-point hitch of a tow vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0069">The invention will be described with reference to the figures forming an integral non-limiting part of the present invention. Throughout the description similar elements will be numbered accordingly.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0070">As will be realized from the figures and description herein the turfplaner is intended for use behind a pull or tow vehicle and most preferably behind a tractor. While not limited thereto, the turfplaner preferably derives power from a Power Take Off (PTO) on a tractor and from the tractor hydraulics. Other embodiments, such as a motor mounted on the turfplaner, are within the scope of the invention but a PTO drive is preferred due to cost and maintenance considerations.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0071">The system comprises a laser which provides a planar fan beam. The turfplaner comprises an elongated cutter which removes material. Laser receivers on either side of the cutter detect whether the cutter is parallel to the fan beam or the correct distance below the fan beam. A rear transport mechanism rides on previously smoothed soil and provides a base. Hydraulic actuators raise, or lower, the blade on each end relative to the base to maintain planarity between the laser receivers and the fan beam at the proper height.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0072">A particularly preferred embodiment of the turfplaner is illustrated and will be described with reference to the figures. The turfplaner comprises a generally rectangular frame comprising a left hand side frame, <b>1</b>, and a right hand side frame, <b>2</b>, with frame supports, <b>3</b>-<b>5</b>, and a front roller, <b>33</b>, spanning there between. A frame tongue, <b>6</b>, and associated brace, <b>7</b>, allow the turfplaner to be towed by a tractor or related tow equipment. A jack, <b>114</b>, and coupler hitch, <b>115</b>, are preferably provided as would be realized.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0073">A drive assembly is illustrated in isolated view in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 21</figref> and will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11</figref>, <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>, <b>21</b> and <b>22</b>. A gear box, <b>109</b>, is mounted on the frame. The gear box can be mounted on a gear box mounting plate, <b>8</b>, for convenience. The gear box couples to the PTO of a tractor through a drive shaft, <b>110</b>. The drive shaft is preferably coupled through universals on either side thereof as would be well known to those of skill in the art. A cover, <b>125</b>, for the drive shaft and universal joints is preferred for safety and aesthetics. Half shafts, <b>112</b>, are coupled to the gear box, <b>109</b>, by half shaft couplers, <b>111</b>, and associated fasteners, <b>113</b>. Each half shaft is preferably supported by a half shaft bearing, <b>96</b>. The half shaft is coupled to a half shaft drive sprocket, <b>100</b>. A half shaft cover, <b>25</b>, with half shaft coupler cover, <b>26</b>, are provided for safety and aesthetics. A hydraulic hose support, <b>94</b>, secures the hydraulic hose extending between the tractor and turfplaner from becoming entangled with other elements. Alternatively, a drive belt, <b>150</b>, can be employed with associated pulleys, <b>151</b> and <b>152</b>, tensioning rollers, <b>105</b>, and bushings, <b>153</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0074">The half shaft drive sprocket, <b>100</b>, is coupled with a cutter head drive sprocket, <b>101</b>. A drive idler sprocket, <b>104</b>, is preferably provided to facilitate installation and tightening of a chain around the sprockets as would be realized in the art. The chain is not shown for clarity. Belts with associated pulleys and tensioning rollers can be used instead of a chain assembly. A preferred chain guard, <b>23</b>, covers the chain and sprockets for safety and aesthetics. A single shaft could be employed but half shafts are preferred to minimize torque.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0075">The cutter assembly will be described with particular reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7</figref>, <b>7</b>A and <b>8</b>. The cutter assembly is attached to the frame. The cutting is accomplished by cutter teeth, <b>83</b>. The cutter teeth are mounted on a cutter bracket, <b>80</b>, with a cutter tooth mount, <b>82</b>, preferably there between. The cutter bracket comprises an inner void for receiving a cutter bushing, <b>81</b>. The cutter bushing is keyed the purpose of which will be more clear from further discussion. The inner voids of a series of cutter bushings are aligned and a cutter head shaft, <b>84</b>, is received in the aligned inner voids. A cutter head keyway, <b>85</b>, is received by the aligned key holes of the bushings. A cutter head nut, <b>86</b>, on either end of the cutter head shaft secures the aligned and assembled cutters. The outer extent of the shaft is received by a cutter head bearing, <b>95</b>, which is mounted to the side frames <b>1</b> and <b>2</b>. As would be realized, the cutter rotation is preferably directly coupled to the PTO of the tractor through the gearing elements illustrated and described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0076">The cutters are preferably arranged in a helical fashion around the cutter head shaft. This provides an optimum cutting operation. It is preferred that the cutter rotate such that the cutter approaches the turf moving towards the direction of travel. In the present illustrations the cutter shaft would rotate clockwise as viewed from the left-hand side of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. This direction of rotation is desirable for several reasons. One reason is an improved cut. Another reason is that the material removed by the cut is transported by the cutters and deposited on a conveyor which will be described further herein. Material is prohibited from falling to the front of the cutter by a front cutting head cover, <b>15</b>, and associated brace, <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0077">The conveyor assembly will be described with particular reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>10</b>, <b>17</b> and <b>20</b>. The conveyor assembly is illustrated in isolation in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 20</figref> and some of the belts are removed for clarity in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>. The conveyor comprises multiple continuous conveyor belts. For the purposes of the instant discussion the conveyor is described as being in three discrete units even though components could be combined or additional conveyor components added. The three components are referred to as the primary conveyor, which removes material from the interior of the turfplaner, an elevator conveyor which raises the material to a height sufficient to be dumped into a support vehicle, and an extension conveyor, which allows the tow vehicle to move beside the turfplaner at a safe distance. A primary conveyor belt, <b>77</b>, preferably just behind the cutting assembly, transits material from the interior of the device and deposits the material on a conveyor elevator belt, <b>78</b>, which then transports the material and deposits material on a conveyor extension belt, <b>79</b>, wherein it is transported to a terminal area wherein it is preferably received by a support vehicle. A conveyor frame, <b>10</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>), provides a support structure for the primary conveyor assembly with rollers, <b>12</b> and <b>69</b>, there between. Primary conveyor belt, <b>77</b>, is supported on one end by a conveyor idler roller, <b>72</b>, which rides in a conveyor hanger bearing, <b>99</b>, and on the other end by a conveyor drive roller (not visible) which is driven by a conveyor hydraulic motor, <b>89</b>. In another embodiment the conveyors would be driven by coupling to the PTO through a gear and chain assembly or the like. The conveyor hanger bearing is attached to the frame by a conveyer hanger bearing rod, <b>74</b>, which allows adjustment of the idler roller to insure the belt does not wander perpendicular to the idler roller during use. Opposite the conveyor idler roller, <b>72</b>, the conveyor belt, <b>77</b>, is supported and driven by a drive roller which is mounted in conveyor bearings, <b>98</b>, and activated by a conveyor hydraulic motor, <b>89</b>. Alternatively, a drive belt, <b>150</b>, can be employed as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>. A conveyor elevator cylinder bracket, <b>106</b>, is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> which would be the point of attachment of a conveyor elevator cylinder (<b>290</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>). The conveyor belt is supported by a conventional conveyor bed plate (not shown). The conveyor bearings, <b>98</b>, are secured to conveyer sides, <b>13</b> and <b>14</b>. A conveyor deflector, <b>11</b>, and rear conveyor cover, <b>16</b>, insure that the material removed by the cutters remains on the conveyor belt. A conveyor cover, <b>18</b>, with a handle, <b>19</b>, for manipulating the cover is provided to prohibit material from leaving the conveyor and for aesthetics. An optional conveyor cover support angle, <b>17</b>, is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0078">The conveyor elevator transports material from the primary conveyor to the conveyor extension. The conveyor elevator comprises a conveyor elevator frame, <b>54</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>), and a conveyor elevator bed, <b>56</b>, which supports the conveyor elevator belt, <b>77</b>. The conveyor elevator has sides, <b>57</b>, and a belt guard, <b>58</b>, for safety and to prohibit material from falling from the belt. The conveyor elevator frame is mounted by a conveyor elevator pivot bracket, <b>59</b>, which is attached to conveyor mounting plates, <b>29</b>. The conveyor elevator belt is strung on a conveyor elevator idler roller, <b>73</b>, which is attached by a conveyor elevator hanger bearing rod, <b>67</b>, and aligned by a conveyor adjuster nut, <b>76</b>. A second conveyor hydraulic motor, <b>90</b>, provides rotational power to the elevator belt through a drive roller, <b>65</b>. The conveyor hydraulic motor, <b>90</b>, may be attached through a coupler as illustrated at <b>107</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>. In one embodiment a single hydraulic motor can be employed yet two are preferred for enhanced control.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0079">The conveyor extension is mounted to the conveyor elevator at a conveyor extension pivot bracket, <b>60</b>. The conveyor elevator has a conveyor extension bed, <b>61</b>, for supporting the conveyor elevator belt and is bound on the sides by conveyor extension sides, <b>62</b>. Conveyor extension supports, <b>63</b>, are preferably provided if necessary, all supported by a conveyor extension frame, <b>55</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). A conveyor elevator spacer, <b>68</b>, is provided if necessary to avoid insufficient clearance between components and, particularly, between belts rotating in non-synchronized fashion.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0080">A transport assembly is provided, preferably, at the rear of the turfplaner. The transport assembly comprises wheels for inoperative transport and a roller which is operational during planing. The transport assembly will be described with particular reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>, <b>5</b>, <b>6</b>, <b>9</b> and <b>12</b>. The transport assembly comprises a roller frame top, <b>34</b>, and roller frame sides, <b>35</b>, generally in the form of an inverted &#x201c;U&#x201d; which, taken together, comprise the main frame. A cylinder roller bracket, <b>36</b>, is mounted on the roller frame top. A transport hydraulic cylinder, <b>50</b>, connects the cylinder bracket roller frame, <b>36</b>, to a roller tankhead, <b>52</b>, which functions to lower and raise the roller pipe, <b>51</b>, into and out of engagement with the ground. The roller pipe, <b>51</b>, is mounted on a roller shaft, <b>53</b>, which is attached on either end to the roller tankhead, <b>52</b>. A roller suspension frame mount, <b>37</b>, on either side attached to the roller frame side, <b>36</b>, connects the lower extent of the transport assembly to the frame sides, <b>2</b> and <b>3</b>, through upper and lower suspension links, <b>42</b>, via a suspension link tie rod, <b>40</b>. A suspension sway link, <b>41</b>, is preferably provided to mitigate improper tracking. Transport wheels and tires, <b>49</b>, are attached to the roller frame sides, <b>35</b>, through a transport leg, <b>44</b>, which receives an axle. The wheel is attached to the axle by a transport spindle and hub, <b>48</b>. The transport leg is attached by a transport pivot pin, <b>45</b>, at a transport pivot bracket, <b>43</b>, on the roller frame side. A transport hydraulic cylinder, <b>50</b>, spanning between a transport cylinder top bracket, <b>46</b>, on the frame and a transport cylinder bottom bracket, <b>47</b>, on the transport leg, <b>44</b>, rotates the wheel into and out of engagement with the ground. A roller scraper, <b>38</b>, removes any material adhering to the scraper thereby providing a continuous smooth scraper surface. The roller scraper is preferably attached to the roller tankhead, <b>52</b>, by roller scraper mounts, <b>38</b>. During use the roller is in engagement with the ground and functions to smooth any undulations remaining from the cutter. During transport the roller is not engaged and the turfplaner is transported on the wheels.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0081">A particular feature is the laser guidance system which is coupled with the hydraulics to maintain the cutter of the turfplaner in a perfectly level orientation relative to the laser beam. In prior art methods the leveling is typically dictated by a monitor based on gravity, such as a bubble level, on the machine. Each pass is therefore uncorrelated to the previous pass with regards to depth of cut. With the present invention a laser with a planar light is set up preferably beyond the location being leveled. Sensors on the turfplaner detect if they are above or below the planar light and adjust the cutter accordingly during use. Therefore, the cutter is maintained in a level orientation and each pass across an area is correlated in identical fashion to the laser. The result is a finished area which is nearly perfectly level relative to the laser after a single pass. Furthermore, the direction of travel is not relevant. Regardless of where the turfplaner is located the cutter can be maintained in a level orientation relative to the planar fan beam as long as the planar laser light can be received.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0082">Laser proportional receivers, <b>118</b>, are slidably attached to a laser mast, <b>32</b>, which is attached to the turfplaner frame by a laser mast mount, <b>30</b>. The laser mast mount is attached to the turfplaner to move in concert with the cutter as would be realized from the description herein. A laser control, <b>116</b>, is preferably situated in a convenient location such that the laser proportional receivers can receive the beam from the laser control over the entire area being planed. The laser proportional receivers are then slid on the laser mast and fixed. The distance between the laser proportional receiver and cutter is therefore fixed and the height of the cutter is adjusted to maintain the laser proportional receiver at the same level as the laser control.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0083">The cutter, transport assembly, and conveyors are preferably all controlled by a common hydraulic system which is illustrated in isolation in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 23</figref>. Laser hydraulic proportional valves, <b>117</b>, react in a subservient manner to a laser electric solenoid, <b>120</b>, to control the height of the cutting head. The hydraulic system for the turfplaner is preferably subservient to the hydraulic system of the tractor and supplied through hydraulic hoses, <b>92</b>, with appropriate junctions, <b>93</b>, attached to the tractor hydraulic system through standard tractor hydraulic connectors, <b>121</b>. The conveyors are manipulated by the conveyor hydraulic motor, <b>89</b>, and conveyor elevator hydraulic motor, <b>90</b>. The machine control hydraulic cylinders, <b>87</b>, attached to a bracket, <b>22</b>, control the height of the cutter relative to the roller pipe, <b>51</b>, with a hydraulic counterbalance valve, <b>88</b>, located in each circuit for control purposes as would be readily understood. The transport assembly is manipulated by the transport hydraulic cylinder, <b>50</b>, conveyor hydraulic motor, <b>89</b>, and conveyor elevator hydraulic motor, <b>90</b>. A hydraulic triple control valve, <b>91</b>, can be used to control conveyor lift hydraulic cylinders, <b>290</b>. The hydraulics can be controlled manually by a manual valve control or the hydraulics could be computer controlled.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0084">In some instances absolute planarity is not desired but, instead, the desire is to conform an adjacent area to existing structure such as a sidewalk, drive surface, curb, aesthetic surface or the like. For example, in the case of a sports field within a track it is highly desirable to provide an autograding device to avoid any deviation from the level of the track and the playing surface adjacent thereto. It would be most desirable to have the first pass of the turfplaner match the level of the track at the interface with the track and have a smooth transition from the interface to the side of the turfplaner furthest from the track. A path the width of the turfplaner would therefore represent a slope, relative to a perpendicular to the track, which is predetermined. The side of the turfplaner opposite the track may be controlled by a laser, as described above, or an autodepth device may be employed, as will be more fully described herein. In subsequent passes the autograding can be used to match the contour of a previous pass and the other side of the turfplaner can be controlled by a laser or an autodepth device.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0085">An embodiment of the turfplaner is illustrated in top view in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, in side view in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15 and 16</figref>, in front view in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> and rear view in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>. A conveyor lift hydraulic cylinder, <b>290</b>, provides for hydraulic lifting of the conveyor. A slope/cone laser, <b>122</b>, and preferred tripod, <b>123</b>, provide a planar laser signal which is received by the laser proportional receiver(s), <b>118</b>, when lasers are used. A turfplaner controller, <b>119</b>, controls the device by monitoring a combination of laser proportional receivers, autograde sensors and autodepth sensors with appropriate signal to the hydraulics to maintain the turfplaner at the proper level on each side. A <b>3</b>-point hitch adapter, <b>140</b>, allows the device to be easily integrated with the typical three-point hitch system of a tractor preferably with a gimbal as will be described further herein. The autograde device, <b>130</b>, and autodepth device, <b>131</b>, will be described in more detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0086">An embodiment of the turfplaner controller, <b>119</b>, is illustrated in isolated view in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>, the turfplaner controller has a power cable, <b>126</b>, for providing power to the controller. A sensor cable, <b>127</b>, receives signals from the various sensors. Cables <b>128</b> and <b>129</b> are interface cables with one interface to the laser control and one interface to the control valves of the hydraulic cylinders.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0087">An embodiment of the autograde device is illustrated in perspective exploded view in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>. An autograde mounting bracket, <b>138</b>, affixes the autograde device to the turfplaner preferably in a position to be near the edge of the most outbound cutter on the side opposite the conveyor. The autograde skid, <b>134</b>, rides along existing structure the contour of which is to be mimicked by the adjacent surface being planed. The length of the autograde skid is chosen to be sufficiently long to traverse minor alterations, such as expansion joints, without alteration yet not so long as to traverse intentional contours. It is preferable that the autograde skid be at least about 15 cm (about 6 inches) to no more than about 61 cm (about 24 inches). Below about 15 cm minor undulations such as expansion joints or variations in the height of adjacent bricks may be realized. Above about 61 cm aesthetic contours may be artificially truncated. The autograde skid preferably has upturned ends to insure that the skid rides on the surface. The autograde skid is mounted to an autograde link, <b>133</b>, preferably with a pivot mount such as mating threaded members, <b>160</b>, or the like. The autograde link is attached to, or integral to, an autograde cam, <b>132</b>, which upon rotation activates at least one autograde microswitch, <b>135</b>. The autograde microswitch relays alterations in contour to the turfplaner controller, <b>119</b>, which activates the appropriate hydraulics to maintain the cutting head at the proper height. In the illustrated embodiment the autograde link is attached to the autograde cam by threaded members and associated washers as would be readily understood, however, any method of coupling movement of the autograde skid to a sensor would be considered within the scope of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0088">An embodiment of the autodepth device is illustrated in side view in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref> and perspective view in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>. An autodepth adjuster, <b>136</b>, fixes the desired height difference between itself and an autodepth bracket, <b>139</b>, which is attached to a portion of the turfplaner which moves in concert with the roller pipe (<b>52</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>). As the autodepth bracket moves up and down relative to the autodepth adjuster, <b>136</b>, an autodepth cam, <b>132</b>, interacts with autodepth micro switches, <b>135</b>. The autodepth micro switches send a signal to the turfplaner control which activates the appropriate hydraulics thereby returning the height of the cutter to the appropriate level.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0089">An embodiment of the invention is illustrated in partial cross-sectional side view in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>, in bottom view in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref>, in perspective view in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref> and in rear view in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref> attached to a three point hitch of a tow vehicle wherein the tow vehicle is illustrated in partial view for simplicity. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 28 and 29</figref> an implement, <b>200</b>, represented as a turf planer is attached to a gimbal, <b>201</b>, comprising an implement plate, <b>206</b>, and a tow plate, <b>208</b>, both of which will be more fully described herein. A top implement arm, <b>204</b>, and bottom implement arm, <b>202</b>, are attached to the implement plate and move in concert therewith. The tow plate is attached to a standard three point hitch comprising lift arms, <b>212</b>, and a stabilizer arm, <b>214</b>, which are well known components in the industry. The lift arms raise and lower in response to the hydraulic, or in some cases electrical, lift system of the tow vehicle and the stabilizer spans the distance between the tow vehicle and implement to prohibit rotating away from the tow vehicle as the implement is lifted.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0090">An embodiment of the gimbal without the tow vehicle or implement is illustrated in perspective front view in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30A</figref>, perspective rear view in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30B</figref> and in exploded front view in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref>. The tow plate, <b>208</b>, comprises lower brackets, <b>210</b>, arranged for mating with the lift arms of the tow vehicle and are typically connected with hitch pins, <b>216</b>, as known in the art. An upper bracket, <b>211</b>, is arranged to mate with the stabilizer arm, <b>214</b>, as known in the art typically with a hitch pin, <b>216</b>. The lower brackets and upper bracket are arranged in a triangle and rotationally fixed relative to the tow vehicle. The implement plate, <b>206</b>, comprises through slots, <b>218</b>. The implement plate is sandwiched between the tow plate, <b>208</b>, and pivot bosses, <b>220</b>, with threaded members, <b>222</b>, passing through the through slots and engaging with mating threaded voids in the tow plate thereby allowing the implement plate to rotate relative to the tow plate as the threaded members slide in the though slots. The pivot bosses limit the arc of rotation of the implement plate relative to the tow plate. In one embodiment the range of the threaded members movement in the slot defines the maximum rotation arc.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0091">A pivot lock cylinder, <b>224</b>, is attached to a cylinder pivot mount, <b>225</b>, on the implement plate and preferably a threaded member. The pivot lock cylinder can be a passive cylinder, such as a hydraulic cylinder, which restricts rotation but which does not otherwise force rotation in one direction or the other. The length of the throw of the pivot lock cylinder is preferably sufficiently long to restrict rotation over the entire arc of rotation allowed by the pivot bosses. Alternatively, the pivot lock cylinder can be an active cylinder which can persuade rotation in one direction or the other, such as by hydraulic force, or can be released thereby allowing free rotation within the range defined by the pivot bosses. The pivot lock cylinder and rotation bosses, taken together provide a pivot restraint capable of restricting, preferably reversibly, the arc of rotation and the rotational freedom from free rotate, when the pivot restraint is released, to persuaded rotation, when the pivot restraint is active, or to no or restricted rotation which is typically for transport. The rotation bosses are referred to herein as an arc restraint and the pivot lock cylinder is referred to herein as a free pivot restraint. In use, it is often desirable for the rotation to be relatively free while in transport it is often desirable for the rotation to be restricted.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0092">An upper implement bracket, <b>226</b>, couples with the top implement arm, <b>204</b>, preferably with a primary pin, <b>228</b>, passing through matching voids. Similarly, a lower implement bracket, <b>230</b>, is coupled to the bottom implement arm, <b>202</b>. A secondary hitch pin, <b>232</b>, can be installed for transport to inhibit rotation on the axis defined by the primary pin. The secondary hitch pin is received by aligned voids or by a void and aligned slot. A swing lock cylinder, <b>234</b>, preferably spanning between a lock cylinder mount, <b>235</b>, and a location on the implement such as the top or bottom implement arm, inhibits swing on the axis defined by the pivot at the upper implement bracket primary pin and therefore functions as a swing restraint. The swing lock cylinder can be a passive cylinder, such as a hydraulic cylinder, which restricts swinging but which does not otherwise force swinging in one direction or the other. Alternatively, the swing lock cylinder can be an active cylinder. The swing lock cylinder preferably allows the tow vehicle to turn, with a pivot joint defined at the upper implement bracket primary pin yet during operation the swing lock cylinder restricts swinging sideways. In one embodiment the swing lock cylinder can be disengaged for turning and either fixed, or resistive, while the implement is in a work mode.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0093">The implement, <b>246</b>, attached to the gimbal can be used for any application wherein it is desirable to decouple rotation of the implement with that of the tow vehicle. Many implements could benefit from the gimbal such as a turfplaner, a turf float or other implements as illustrated schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</figref> such as a flail mower (A), an auger or post hole-digger (B), a broom mower (C), a finish mower (D), a spreader (E), a tiller (F), a plow (G), a tree cutter (H), a landscape rake (I), a box (J), a blade (K), a harrow (L) and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0094">The PTO drive shaft, <b>248</b>, preferably passes through central voids in the gimbal thereby allowing for a direct connection between the power take off shaft of the tow vehicle and the power head of the implement.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0095">An embodiment of the gimbal is illustrated in perspective view in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39</figref> and in exploded perspective view in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</figref> wherein bosses do not limit rotation of the tow plate relative to the implement plate. In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 39 and 40</figref> the implement plate <b>206</b> comprises a retaining lip, <b>300</b>, extending from the implement plate and circumnavigating or encasing a retaining cavity within which the tow plate is contained preferably with free rotation therein. The retaining lip may be integral to the implement plate, such as being formed by a single component or attached by welding, or the retraining ring may be a ring reversibly mounted to the implement plate to retain the tow plate in the retaining cavity. A retraining ring, <b>302</b>, attached to the implement plate, preferably at the retaining lip and preferably removably attached thereto, secures the tow plate within the retaining cavity wherein the retaining cavity is bound by the implement plate, the retaining lip and the retraining ring thereby allowing free rotation of the tow plate relative to the implement plate and parallel to the implement plate face. As would be realized, rotational limits can be imposed by the pivot lock cylinder, <b>224</b>, or the pivot lock cylinder can be disengaged for free rotation of the tow plate. A central void, <b>310</b>, through the gimbal allows a PTO driveshaft to pass through the gimbal, as illustrated in at least <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref>, thereby allowing the implement to be powered by the power take off (PTO) of the tow vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0096">An embodiment of the invention is illustrated in rear perspective view in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</figref>, in top view in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</figref> and in side view in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</figref> wherein the gimbal, <b>201</b> is attached to an implement, <b>200</b>, represented as a turf float.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0097">The embodiment illustrated has a conveyor which is in a fixed orientation relative to the direction of travel for the turf planer. Other embodiments are envisioned with the conveyor being capable of discharging from either side, the front or the back. A conveyor which rotates relative to the direction of travel is considered within the scope of the invention yet this is less desirable due to cost considerations. It is most preferable that the direction of travel be such that the conveyor discharges away from previously planed areas. This arrangement is preferable since it is desirable to avoid spillage of discharged material onto previously planed areas and it is desirable to not have transport vehicles on previously planed areas. It is most preferred that the autograde device be on the side opposite the conveyor since the grade being mimicked is typically an aesthetically pleasing or functional area and it is therefore desirable to avoid spillage and traffic thereon. Though an autograde device could be on both sides this is undesirable since the redundant devices increase cost and are typically not necessary. Similarly, the autodepth device is preferably on the side of the conveyor. Though an autodepth device could be on both sides this is undesirable since the redundant devices increase cost and are typically not necessary.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0098">The turf planer provides significant flexibility. The depth or height of the cut on either side is independent of the other and the cut is independent of the movement of the tow vehicle as it transits pre-planed turf. One side can be controlled by an autograde device or a laser and the other side can be controlled by an autodepth device or a laser. Each pass of the machine across an area can be accomplished using different combinations of laser, autodepth and autograde to provide an area which is contoured to a specified predetermined shape. As would be realized the cutting height can be manipulated by manual control if desired.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0099">Various components of the turfplaner are illustrated which are not specifically recited herein. Specifically, various covers, brackets, bushings, spacers, supports, etc. which would be included for structural strength, aesthetics to avoid contact between various components or as safety barriers are not specifically called out but are set forth in the figures and would be readily understood to be a design choice by one of skill in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0100">The turf planer is particularly suitable for any application wherein the planarity of an area is of utmost concern. The turf planer can also be used to crown, or slope, areas with great precision by setting the two laser proportional receivers at different heights representative of the desired slope there between or through the use of the autograde or autodepth devices. Alternatively, each laser proportional receiver can be the same distance from the cutter and the laser fan can be tilted relative to gravity to provide a predetermined slope.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0101">The turf planer eliminates multiple passes to level an area or to make the area coplanar with an adjacent area. In practice, the turf planer can provide a surface which is level within 1/16 of an inch. This is previously unobtainable with prior art technologies, especially, in a single pass.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0102">A particular application is in weed control. Some grasses, such as Bermuda grass, have a root system which is well below the surface of the ground. Therefore, the turf planer can be used to scalp the surface down to a level which is above the root system of the grass or similar vegetation. Any weed, or unwanted vegetation, which has a shallow root system will be removed and the grass will quickly rise from the roots up through the surface. This provides a system for removing weeds and unwanted vegetation without chemicals. Furthermore, the area can be leveled and deweeded in a single pass.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0103">The invention has been described with particular reference to the preferred embodiments without limit thereto. One of skill in the art would readily realize additional embodiments, alterations and improvements which are not specifically enumerated herein but which are within the scope of the invention as specifically set forth in the claims appended hereto.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The invention relates generally to seeders or row-crop planters or and, in particular, seeders and planters for planting multiple varieties of seed with a single implement.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Modern farming practices strive to increase yields of agricultural fields. Technological advances of planters allow for better agronomic characteristics at the time of planting, such as providing more accurate seed depth, improved uniformity of seed depth across the planter, and improved accuracy of in-row seed spacing. However, a single field can have performance inconsistencies between different areas. That is because a field can have a wide variety of soil types and management zones such as irrigated and non-irrigated zones in different areas. Seed companies are developing multiple varieties of each of their seed product types, with the different varieties offering improved performance characteristics for different types of soil and management practices. Efforts have been made to plant multiple varieties of a particular seed product type in different areas of fields with different soil types or management zones. These efforts include seeders with complex valves that change which stored seeds can enter a metering box. Other efforts include planters that have different bulk fill hoppers and require the reservoir for each seed meter to be completely cleaned out or planted out before a different seed variety can be delivered to the seed meters. Some planters allow for planting two varieties and include two separate and distinct seed meters at every row unit.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention is directed to agricultural implements with systems for seeding or planting multiple seed types. The systems can be implemented with seeders or planters and can use look-ahead predictions and controls to coordinate seed type delivery switchover in a manner that minimizes mixing different seed types during the switchover. In one embodiment, controlling initial primary delivery of seed may be done exclusively through controlling primary metering or deliver from bulk storage by way of a primary delivery system. In one embodiment, this may be done without flow-stopping ancillary gates or valves within a primary or bulk delivery system, but instead by individually controlling primary delivery assemblies such as metering rollers to selectively deliver seeds of different types from bulk storage. In one embodiment, the agricultural implement is a planter with mini-hoppers that receive seeds from bulk storage. Each of the mini-hoppers can be filled with an amount of a particular type of seed needed to plant a zone across which a row unit fed by the respective mini-hopper travels while the planter moves across the field. The mini-hoppers at different row units can be filled with different types of seed depending on which zone of the field, for example, according to a prescription map, that the row unit will be in while the planter moves across the field. The mini-hoppers can have sensors communicating with a control system for filling the mini-hoppers with an amount of seeds of a particular variety needed for planting a particular segment of the field. A control system can look ahead along a travel path that may correspond to a current heading direction of the tractor implement to predict how much of a particular seed type is needed to plant a zone being traveled through along the travel path. In one embodiment, if the required amount can be held in the mini-hoppers, then the entire required amount of seed of that variety is pre-fed to the mini-hoppers during a fill phase and then delivery of seed from bulk storage is halted. A seed-out phase is defined when delivery of seeds from bulk storage is halted and the seeds in the mini-hoppers are delivered to the field, depleting the volume of seeds stored locally on the row units. A subsequent fill phase begins when the implement approaches a boundary between zones of a field and reaches a target distance from the boundary that, based on current or average travel speed, corresponds to a distance traveled over a time period that corresponds to a time required for seeds to travel from bulk storage through the implement to the mini-hoppers.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">According to one aspect of the invention, a control system uses a prescription map to look ahead to coordinate out-of-implement or to-ground seed type delivery switch-over events of seeding and/or planting implements with the implements crossing boundaries between different variety zones of an agricultural field. This allows for seeding or planting multiple types of seed, which may include planting at varying rates, in a single planting pass without having to add additional row units or meters.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">According to one aspect of the invention, a method is provided for delivering multiple types of seed onto an agricultural field with an agricultural implement. The method includes moving an implement along a travel path through multiple zones including at least a first zone and a second zone of an agricultural field. Each of the multiple zones corresponds to a characteristic of the agricultural field relating to at least one of soil type and management type. Seeds of multiple types are selectively released. The multiple types of seed include at least a first type and a second type that are released from the agricultural implement onto the agricultural field at the first and second zones. Seed delivery is switched from releasing seeds of the first type to releasing seeds of the second type from the agricultural implement at a boundary defined between the first and second zones. This is done by coordinating the switching from releasing seeds of the first to the second type through a controlled predicted exhaustion of seeds of the first type. The coordinating of the switching includes preemptively deactivating a primary delivery system preventing further delivery of the seed to the first type from the bulk storage system before the agricultural implement reaches the boundary. The primary delivery system is preemptively activated to initiate delivery of the seed of the second type from the bulk storage system before the agricultural implement reaches the boundary such that the initial release of the seed on the second type out of the agricultural implement is coordinated with the agricultural implement crossing the boundary between the first and second zones. This allows a control system that controls the primary delivery system to look ahead and plan seed type switchover events, including fully depleting a seed type conveyed through the agricultural implement to be released onto a particular zone at the same time that a different seed type starts its conveyance through the agricultural implement, reducing mixing of the seed types near the boundary between adjacent zones.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to another aspect of the invention, a required amount is determined for seed of the first or second type needed to deliver onto a portion of the agricultural field while the agricultural implement travels along a travel path through one of the first and second zones. The required amount of the first or second type of seed is delivered with the primary delivery system for temporary storage of the first or second type on the agricultural implement downstream of the bulk storage system during release of the seed of the first or second type onto the agricultural field.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to another aspect of the invention, the agricultural implement may be a planter having multiple row units with mini-hoppers. Seeds of one of the multiple types are delivered from the bulk storage system to the mini-hoppers and delivery of seeds from the mini-hoppers are delivered to seed meters at the row units for singulation and individual release onto the agricultural field. Seed level sensors are arranged with respect to the mini-hoppers for detecting amounts of seeds in chambers of the mini-hoppers. The primary delivery system is activated to deliver seed of the first or second type to the mini-hoppers until the seed level sensors provide a signal indicating that the required amount of seed of the first or second type is within the mini-hoppers. This allows for batch pre-feeding of the required amount of seed needed for a particular zone during travel along the travel path which will be exhausted by release onto the agricultural field as coordinated with the agricultural implement reaching the boundary between the current and next zone.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to another aspect of the invention, the primary delivery system includes first and second primary delivery assemblies. The first primary delivery assembly is activated to deliver seeds of the first variety from the bulk storage system for release from the agricultural implement and the second primary delivery assembly is activated to deliver seeds of the second variety from the bulk storage system for release from the agricultural implement. The first and second primary delivery assemblies include rollers that are rotated during activation of the first and second primary delivery assemblies to deliver seeds of the first and second types from the bulk storage system. Rotation of the rollers is stopped when the first and second primary delivery assemblies are deactivating to prevent delivery of the seeds of the respective first and second types out of the corresponding one of the first and second compartments of the bulk storage system. The rollers of the first and second primary delivery assemblies may be arranged in outlets of first and second compartments of the bulk storage system respectively storing seeds of the first and second types.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to another aspect of the invention, an implement is moved along a travel path through a first zone of an agricultural field that corresponds to a first characteristic of the agricultural field relating to at least one of soil type and management type. A first primary delivery assembly is activated to deliver seeds of a first type from a first compartment of a bulk storage system through the implement for release onto the agricultural field.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">An approaching boundary is identified that will be crossed by the agricultural implement moving along the travel path. The boundary is defined between the first zone and a second zone of the agricultural field. The second zone corresponds to a second characteristic of the agricultural field relating to at least one of soil type and management type. The first primary delivery assembly is deactivated before the implement crosses the boundary between the first and second zones to stop delivery of the seeds of the first type from the first compartment through the implement before the implement crosses the boundary between the first and second zones. A second primary delivery assembly is activated to deliver seeds of a second type from a second compartment of a bulk storage system through the implement for initial release onto the agricultural field at a time that corresponds to the implement crossing the boundary between the first and second zones.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to another aspect of the invention, an agricultural implement is provided for delivering multiple types of seed onto an agricultural field. The implement has a bulk storage system including a first compartment storing seeds of a first type and a second compartment storing seeds of a second type. A primary delivery system includes a first primary delivery assembly arranged with respect to the first compartment to selectively deliver the seeds of the first type through the agricultural implement for release onto the agricultural field and a second primary delivery assembly arranged with respect to the second compartment to selectively deliver the seeds of the second type through the agricultural implement for release onto the agricultural field. A control system is operably connected to the primary delivery system. The control system is configured to activate the first primary delivery assembly while the agricultural implement travels along a travel path through a first zone of an agricultural field, with the first zone corresponding to a first characteristic of the agricultural field relating to at least one of soil type and management type. An approaching boundary is identified to be crossed by the agricultural implement moving along the travel path. The boundary is defined between the first zone and a second zone of the agricultural field that corresponds to a second characteristic of the agricultural field relating to at least one of soil type and management type.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The first primary delivery assembly is deactivated before the agricultural implement crosses the boundary between the first and second zones to stop delivery of the seeds of the first type from the first compartment through the agricultural implement before the agricultural implement crosses the boundary between the first and second zones. The second primary delivery assembly is activated to deliver seeds of the second type from the second compartment through the agricultural implement for initial release of the seeds of the second type onto the agricultural field at a time that corresponds to the agricultural implement crossing the boundary between the first and second zones.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Each of the first and second primary delivery assemblies can include a roller that rotates while the respective first and second primary delivery assembly is activated to deliver the seeds of the respective first and second types out of the corresponding one of the first and second compartments of the bulk storage system. The roller of each of the first and second primary delivery assemblies does not rotate while the respective first and second primary delivery assembly is deactivated to prevent delivery of the seeds of the respective first and second types out of the corresponding one of the first and second compartments of the bulk storage system. The rollers of the first and second primary delivery assemblies are arranged in outlets of the first and second compartments of the bulk storage system.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The agricultural implement can be a planter including an on-row storage system receiving seeds from the primary delivery system and having multiple row units supporting seed meters receiving seeds from the on-row storage system for singulating and delivering the seeds to the agricultural field. The on-row storage system can include mini-hoppers at the multiple row units having chambers receiving seeds from the primary delivery system and providing seeds to the seed meters. The control system can include seed level sensors arranged with respect to the mini-hoppers for detecting amounts of seeds in the chambers of the mini-hoppers. The agricultural implement can be a seeder that may include an air drill and the first and second primary delivery assemblies can include metering boxes having calibrated fluted metering rollers.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In one embodiment, the implement is a planter and when the planter first starts in the field, the bulk tank compartment containing the seed type that is to be planted first feeds the correct amount of seed to each row unit seed meter. This may be done by activating a primary delivery system to deliver a calibrated amount of the seed type to a mini-hopper at each row unit. The amount of seed necessary for each individual row unit can be calculated based on the prescription map PM and the known population. Seed level sensors in the seed reservoir or chamber of the mini-hopper are used to determine the amount of seed in each seed reservoir or chamber. Once the proper amount of seed is fed into the meter reservoir of chamber of the mini-hopper, a gate located at the bulk tank compartment is shut or a roller is deactivated and stopped for that particular row unit. If there is not enough seed in the reservoir or chamber of the mini-hopper to plant this seed type before it has to switch, the gate remains open or the roller remains activated and rotating until the planter reaches a point where the control system determines that the reservoir or chamber of the mini-hopper has enough seed to reach an inter-zone boundary between the current and next zone of the next seed type for that particular row. When the planter row unit reaches the boundary for the next seed type, almost all of the seed in the reservoir or chamber of the mini-hopper, for example, only enough seed to plant about another five feet or less, such as less than about three feet worth of seed remains. As soon as this occurs, the gate for the next seed variety is opened or the roller for the next seed variety is activated to rotate and the process is repeated.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Referring now to the drawings and specifically to the simplified schematic representations of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-2</figref>, a system <b>5</b> is shown that is used with an agricultural implement <b>7</b> and is configured for seeding or planting multiple seed types onto different zones of an agricultural field. The system <b>5</b> can use look-ahead predictions and controls to coordinate seed type delivery switchover in a manner that minimizes mixing different seed types during the switchover, as explained in greater detail elsewhere herein. Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in this embodiment, the implement <b>7</b> incorporating system <b>5</b> is a seeder <b>7</b><i>a </i>that may include an air drill, such as an ATX700 air drill available from Case IH, and an air cart, such as a PRECISION AIR&#xae; air cart available from Case IH, both towed behind a traction device such as tractor <b>9</b>. Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, in this embodiment, the implement <b>7</b> incorporating system <b>5</b> is a planter <b>7</b><i>b </i>such as one of the EARLY RISER&#xae; series planters available from Case IH and is towed behind tractor <b>9</b>. Each implement <b>5</b> includes a frame <b>13</b> that supports multiple row units <b>15</b> that are substantially identical. The row units <b>15</b> have ground-engaging tools that may include opening and closing mechanisms such as opener disks and closing disks, respectively, or other ground-engaging tools for opening and closing a furrow. The ground-engaging tools may also include a gauge wheel configured for adjusting furrow depth by limiting soil penetration of the furrow-opening mechanism of the ground-engaging tools while creating a furrow, and a press wheel may be arranged to roll over the closed furrow to firm the soil over the seed to further close the furrow and promote favorable seed-to-soil contact.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-2</figref>, an airflow system <b>19</b> provides pneumatic power for use by various implement <b>7</b> components and is used to convey seeds <b>21</b> through the implement <b>5</b> to the row units <b>15</b> for release onto the field. Airflow system <b>19</b> includes a positive air pressure source and may include a vacuum source for establishing positive and vacuum pressures and corresponding air flows. The positive air pressure source and vacuum sources can be known pumps, fans, blowers, and/or other known airflow system components. Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A-4B</figref>, the airflow system <b>19</b> can include a seed conveyance airflow system <b>19</b><i>a </i>providing an airflow that entrains seeds <b>21</b> to move the seeds <b>21</b> from bulk storage to the row units <b>15</b> and a seed meter airflow system <b>19</b><i>b </i>provides native and/or positive pressure for operation of seed meters at the row units <b>15</b>, as explained in greater detail elsewhere herein. Each of the seed conveyance and seed meter airflow systems <b>19</b><i>a</i>, <b>19</b><i>b </i>includes a positive air pressure source(s) and/or vacuum source(s), depending on the particular configurations of the pneumatic system(s) in which they are incorporated. Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-2</figref>, the airflow system <b>19</b> such as the seed conveyance airflow system <b>19</b><i>a </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A-4B</figref>) may connect to a seed receiving induction system or bulk metering box(es) or otherwise be operatively connected to a seed-delivery system <b>23</b> that has primary lines or primary seed conduits <b>25</b> that connect to secondary lines or secondary seed conduits <b>27</b> at the row units <b>15</b>. Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the seeder <b>7</b><i>a </i>includes a manifold <b>29</b> that interconnects each primary seed conduit <b>25</b> with its corresponding secondary seed conduits <b>27</b> that are operably connected to seed tubes <b>28</b><i>a </i>that release seeds <b>21</b> entrained in an airflow from the seeder <b>7</b><i>a </i>to the field.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, the planter <b>7</b><i>b </i>has junctions <b>30</b> at which the secondary seed conduits <b>27</b> branch off from the primary seed conduits <b>25</b> for directing seeds <b>21</b> to be singulated in seed meters <b>28</b><i>b </i>that release individual seeds <b>21</b> through the seed tubes <b>28</b><i>a </i>to the field. Each seed meter <b>28</b><i>b </i>can be a purely mechanical-type seed meter <b>28</b><i>b </i>or a pneumatic seed meter <b>28</b><i>b</i>. The seed meter <b>28</b><i>b </i>includes an internal seed disk that is rotated by a seed disk drive system to rotate at least a surface of the seed disk through a seed pool inside of the seed meter <b>28</b><i>b </i>to pick up and singulate seeds from the internal seed pool and convey the individual seeds through the seed meter <b>28</b><i>b </i>for individual release out of the seed meter <b>28</b><i>b </i>through the seed tube <b>28</b><i>a</i>. Pneumatic seed meters <b>28</b><i>b </i>of negative pressure types are further operably connected to the seed meter airflow system <b>19</b><i>b </i>of the airflow system <b>19</b> to provide a vacuum airflow within a vacuum chamber establishing a negative or vacuum pressure within the seed meter <b>28</b><i>b </i>opposite the seed pool allowing the seeds to be held against the seed disk by the vacuum pressure. Pneumatic seed meters <b>28</b><i>b </i>of positive pressure types are operably connected to the seed meter airflow system <b>19</b><i>b </i>to provide a positive airflow and a corresponding positive pressure at the seed side of the seed disk within the seed meter <b>28</b><i>b</i>, whereby seeds from the seed pool are pushed and held against the seed disk by positive pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-2</figref>, the seeds <b>21</b> are held in bulk storage in a bulk storage system <b>31</b> with at least one bulk fill hopper <b>33</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows one bulk fill hopper <b>33</b> used with the seeder <b>7</b><i>a</i>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows two central bulk fill hoppers <b>33</b> supported by the frame <b>13</b> of the planter <b>7</b><i>a</i>. The bulk storage system <b>31</b> has multiple compartments <b>35</b>, shown here as spaces within each of the bulk fill hoppers <b>33</b> that are separated by divider walls or partitions <b>36</b>. In another embodiment, the compartments <b>35</b> are defined by separate and discrete containers themselves, such as multiple bulk fill hoppers <b>33</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>). The different compartments <b>35</b> of the hoppers <b>33</b> may hold seeds <b>21</b> of a common plant type but different varieties or types <b>21</b><i>a</i>, <b>21</b><i>b</i>, <b>21</b><i>c</i>, <b>21</b><i>d </i>for planting in different type or variety zones, shown as zones VZ<b>1</b>, VZ<b>2</b>, VZ<b>3</b>, VZ<b>4</b> in the prescriptions map PM of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. The different type or variety zones VZ<b>1</b>, VZ<b>2</b>, VZ<b>3</b>, VZ<b>4</b> of the agricultural field are defined at least in part by characteristics relating to at least one of soil type and management type. Although the seed <b>21</b> may be described elsewhere herein as different types <b>21</b><i>a</i>, <b>21</b><i>b</i>, <b>21</b><i>c</i>, <b>21</b><i>d</i>, it is understood that the description of the different types includes different varieties. In other words, the different types <b>21</b><i>a</i>, <b>21</b><i>b</i>, <b>21</b><i>c</i>, <b>21</b><i>d </i>of seed <b>21</b> include not only different varieties of the same plant species, but also different seed products. Different seed products can include seeds of different species, coated and uncoated seeds, such as insecticide coated and non-insecticide coated seeds. The different seed products can also include refuge in a bag seed and non-refuge in a bag seed, plant-parasite resistant seed and non-plant-parasite resistant seed such as cyst nematodes resistant seeds and non-cyst nematodes resistant seeds, herbicide-tolerant seed and non-herbicide-tolerant seed, or other different products. The different seed products can further include different crop seeds such as corn and soybeans.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-2</figref>, a primary delivery system <b>37</b> releases or delivers seeds <b>21</b>, such as by calibrated metering, from bulk storage in the bulk storage system <b>31</b> into the seed delivery system <b>23</b> for conveyance to the row units <b>15</b>. Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-4</figref><i>b</i>, the primary delivery system <b>37</b> includes multiple primary delivery assemblies <b>39</b>. Each primary delivery assembly <b>39</b> has a metering roller(s) <b>41</b> which may be a calibrated fluted roller arranged at each outlet <b>43</b> of the bulk fill hoppers <b>33</b> or at each of the separate compartments <b>35</b> of a single bulk fill hopper <b>33</b> that holds all of the seed types <b>21</b><i>a</i>, <b>21</b><i>b</i>, <b>21</b><i>c</i>, <b>21</b><i>d </i>in its separate compartments <b>35</b>. The rollers <b>41</b> are driven to rotate by electronic, pneumatic, or hydraulic motors (not shown) as controlled by the control system <b>45</b>. The control system <b>45</b> is operably connected to rollers <b>41</b> for controlling the primary delivery system <b>37</b> to deliver seed <b>21</b> from the bulk storage system <b>31</b> based on look-ahead predictions to coordinate planting seeds <b>21</b> of different types <b>21</b><i>a</i>, <b>21</b><i>b</i>, <b>21</b><i>c</i>, <b>21</b><i>d </i>into the different zones of the agricultural field, as explained in greater detail elsewhere herein, by synchronizing various switching events manners that minimize mixing different seed types during the switchover(s).</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-2</figref>, control system <b>45</b> includes an implement controller <b>47</b> which may be a seeder controller or a planter controller and a tractor controller <b>49</b>. The components of the control system <b>45</b> including the implement and tractor controllers <b>47</b>, <b>49</b> operably communicate with each other, for example, by way of an ISOBUS connection, for coordinating controls of the implement <b>7</b> to deliver seeds <b>21</b> from the row units <b>15</b> based on the type or variety zones VZ<b>1</b>, VZ<b>2</b>, VZ<b>3</b>, VZ<b>4</b> of the agricultural field, which may correspond to a seed type or variety prescription map PM as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. The implement controller <b>47</b> is shown including a controller <b>51</b> and a power supply <b>53</b>. The controller <b>51</b> of the implement controller <b>47</b> can include an industrial computer or, e.g., a programmable logic controller (PLC), along with corresponding software and suitable memory for storing such software and hardware including interconnecting conductors for power and signal transmission for controlling electronic, electro-mechanical, and hydraulic components of the seed delivery system <b>23</b> including the primary delivery system <b>37</b> and other components of the implement <b>7</b> such as the airflow system <b>19</b>. The tractor controller <b>49</b> is configured for controlling operations of the tractor <b>9</b> such as controlling steering, speed, braking, shifting, and other operations of the tractor <b>9</b>. The tractor controller <b>49</b> is shown as including a controller <b>55</b> and power supply <b>57</b>. The tractor controller <b>49</b> is configured for controlling the functions of the tractor <b>9</b> by controlling the various GPS steering, transmission, engine, hydraulic, and/or other systems of the tractor <b>9</b>. Like the controller <b>51</b> of the implement controller <b>47</b>, the controller <b>55</b> of the tractor controller <b>49</b> can include an industrial computer or, e.g., a programmable logic controller, along with corresponding software and suitable memory for storing such software and hardware including interconnecting conductors for power and signal transmission for controlling electronic, electro-mechanical, and hydraulic components of the tractor <b>9</b>. A tractor interface system <b>59</b> is operably connected to the tractor controller <b>49</b> and includes a monitor and various input devices to allow an operator to see the statuses and to control various operations of the tractor <b>9</b> from within the cab of the tractor <b>9</b>. The tractor interface system <b>59</b> may be a MultiControl Armrest&#x2122; console available for use with the Maxxum&#x2122; or Magnum&#x2122; series tractors from Case IH.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, in this embodiment with the seeder <b>7</b><i>a </i>as implement <b>7</b>, control system <b>45</b> controls rotation of the rollers <b>41</b> within metering boxes <b>61</b> of the primary delivery assemblies <b>39</b>. Controlling rotation of the rollers <b>41</b> includes controlling rotational characteristics such as starting, stopping, and rotational speed of the rollers <b>41</b> to provide selective and calibrated release of the seed types <b>21</b><i>a</i>, <b>21</b><i>b</i>, <b>21</b><i>c</i>, <b>21</b><i>d </i>onto the zones VZ<b>1</b>, VZ<b>2</b>, VZ<b>3</b>, VZ<b>4</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>). This can be achieved by predicting with the control system <b>45</b> when the tractor <b>9</b> and/or implement <b>7</b> will reach an inter-zone boundary B (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) and stopping delivery of a current seed type(s) <b>21</b><i>a</i>, <b>21</b><i>b</i>, <b>21</b><i>c</i>, <b>21</b><i>d </i>being delivered in a current zone(s) VZ<b>1</b>, VZ<b>2</b>, VZ<b>3</b>, VZ<b>4</b> and starting release of a subsequent seed type(s) <b>21</b><i>a</i>, <b>21</b><i>b</i>, <b>21</b><i>c</i>, <b>21</b><i>d </i>before reaching the inter-zone boundary B between the current zone(s) VZ<b>1</b>, VZ<b>2</b>, VZ<b>3</b>, VZ<b>4</b> and a subsequent zone(s) VZ<b>1</b>, VZ<b>2</b>, VZ<b>3</b>, VZ<b>4</b> being approached, as explained in greater detail elsewhere herein. In some embodiments, one or more of the zones VZ<b>1</b>, VZ<b>2</b>, VZ<b>3</b>, VZ<b>4</b> is defined to require a predetermined mixture of two or more of the seed types <b>21</b><i>a</i>, <b>21</b><i>b</i>, <b>21</b><i>c</i>, <b>21</b><i>d</i>, whereby the control system <b>45</b> controls rotation of the rollers <b>41</b> to create a purposeful mixture based on the desired predetermined mixture ratio. As one example, the control system <b>45</b> delivers a purposeful mixture of 25% seed type <b>21</b><i>a </i>and 75% seed type <b>21</b><i>b </i>by rotating the respective rollers <b>41</b> with a rotational speed differential and proportionally controlling the rotational speeds of the rollers <b>41</b> to achieve the 25% seed type <b>21</b><i>a </i>and 75% seed type <b>21</b><i>b </i>mixture.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, in this embodiment with the planter <b>7</b><i>b </i>as implement <b>7</b>, control system <b>45</b> controls rotation of the rollers <b>41</b> to control rotational characteristics such as starting, stopping, and rotational speed of the rollers <b>41</b> to provide selective and calibrated release of the seed types <b>21</b><i>a</i>, <b>21</b><i>b</i>, <b>21</b><i>c</i>, <b>21</b><i>d </i>onto the zones VZ<b>1</b>, VZ<b>2</b>, VZ<b>3</b>, VZ<b>4</b>. This can be achieved by predicting with the control system <b>45</b> when the tractor <b>9</b> and/or implement <b>7</b> will reach an inter-zone boundary B (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) and stopping delivery of a current seed type(s) <b>21</b><i>a</i>, <b>21</b><i>b</i>, <b>21</b><i>c</i>, <b>21</b><i>d </i>being delivered in a current zone(s) VZ<b>1</b>, VZ<b>2</b>, VZ<b>3</b>, VZ<b>4</b> and starting release of a subsequent seed type(s) <b>21</b><i>a</i>, <b>21</b><i>b</i>, <b>21</b><i>c</i>, <b>21</b><i>d </i>before reaching the inter-zone boundary B between the current zone(s) VZ<b>1</b>, VZ<b>2</b>, VZ<b>3</b>, VZ<b>4</b> and a subsequent zone(s) VZ<b>1</b>, VZ<b>2</b>, VZ<b>3</b>, VZ<b>4</b> being approached, as explained in greater detail elsewhere herein. As part of the predictive switchover in this embodiment, the control system <b>45</b> may batch pre-feed a required amount of seed <b>21</b> needed for a particular zone VZ<b>1</b>, VZ<b>2</b>, VZ<b>3</b>, VZ<b>4</b> during travel along the travel path, which will be exhausted by release onto the agricultural field as coordinated with the agricultural implement reaching the inter-zone boundary B between the current and next zones VZ<b>1</b>, VZ<b>2</b>, VZ<b>3</b>, VZ<b>4</b>. As described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, in some embodiments, one or more of the zones VZ<b>1</b>, VZ<b>2</b>, VZ<b>3</b>, VZ<b>4</b> is defined to require a predetermined mixture of two or more of the seed types <b>21</b><i>a</i>, <b>21</b><i>b</i>, <b>21</b><i>c</i>, <b>21</b><i>d</i>, whereby the control system <b>45</b> controls the seed-delivery system <b>23</b> to simultaneously release seeds <b>21</b> of more than one seed type <b>21</b><i>a</i>, <b>21</b><i>b</i>, <b>21</b><i>c</i>, <b>21</b><i>d</i>, which may include controlling relative rotational speeds of the rollers <b>41</b>, to create a purposeful mixture based on the desired predetermined mixture ratio of the more than one seed type <b>21</b><i>a</i>, <b>21</b><i>b</i>, <b>21</b><i>c</i>, <b>21</b><i>d </i>for the corresponding zone(s) VZ<b>1</b>, VZ<b>2</b>, VZ<b>3</b>, VZ<b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, control system <b>45</b> implements batch feeding by monitoring seed levels of seed <b>21</b> held in an on-row storage system <b>63</b> and making decisions relating to delivery of seed <b>21</b> from the bulk storage system <b>31</b> to be held in the on-row storage system <b>63</b> for planned depletion of a type(s) of seeds <b>21</b><i>a</i>, <b>21</b><i>b</i>, <b>21</b><i>c</i>, <b>21</b><i>d </i>in the on-row storage system <b>63</b> before feeding a batch of different type(s) of seeds <b>21</b><i>a</i>, <b>21</b><i>b</i>, <b>21</b><i>c</i>, <b>21</b><i>d </i>to the on-row storage system <b>63</b>. The on-row storage system <b>63</b> includes mini-hoppers <b>65</b> that may be vented mini-hoppers with chambers <b>67</b> receiving seeds <b>21</b> from the bulk storage system <b>31</b> and perforated lids (not shown) that cover the mini-hoppers and allow air to escape the chambers <b>67</b> while seeds <b>21</b> collect for temporary storage in the chambers <b>67</b> before feeding into the seed meters <b>28</b><i>b</i>. Seed level sensors <b>69</b> are arranged in the mini-hopper chambers <b>67</b> to provide signals allowing the control system <b>45</b> to evaluate how much seed <b>21</b> of the seed types <b>21</b><i>a</i>, <b>21</b><i>b</i>, <b>21</b><i>c</i>, <b>21</b><i>d </i>is in chamber <b>67</b> at each of the row units <b>15</b>. In this way, control system <b>45</b> can use signals from the seed level sensors <b>69</b> to evaluate current state fill level of a particular seed type <b>21</b><i>a</i>, <b>21</b><i>b</i>, <b>21</b><i>c</i>, <b>21</b><i>d </i>relative to how much more seed <b>21</b> of that particular type <b>21</b><i>a</i>, <b>21</b><i>b</i>, <b>21</b><i>c</i>, <b>21</b><i>d </i>is needed at the corresponding row unit <b>15</b> to complete the planting of the current zone(s) VZ<b>1</b>, VZ<b>2</b>, VZ<b>3</b>, VZ<b>4</b> along the travel path before reaching an approaching inter-zone boundary B for that row unit <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, a seed gate system <b>71</b> allows for precisely filling batches of seed <b>21</b> of a particular type <b>21</b><i>a</i>, <b>21</b><i>b</i>, <b>21</b><i>c</i>, <b>21</b><i>d </i>into selected rows of the mini-hoppers <b>65</b> as pre-feeding during a fill phase of the system <b>5</b> for planned depletion during a seed-out phase. The seed gate system <b>71</b> includes a seed gate <b>73</b> at each of the junctions <b>30</b> that are independently moved by respective actuators <b>75</b> which may be electronic, pneumatic, or hydraulic actuators to direct seed <b>21</b> into one(s) of the secondary seed conduit(s) <b>27</b> of one(s) of the row units <b>15</b> for filling the chamber <b>67</b> of the respective mini-hopper <b>65</b> of the on-row storage system <b>63</b>. Seed gates <b>73</b> are shown as movable between two positions. The first position is represented by the seed gate <b>73</b> shown in solid line at the left-most row unit <b>15</b>. In this first position, the seed gate <b>73</b> is fully open to its respective row unit <b>15</b> and closed with respect to downstream units <b>15</b>. Accordingly, at the junction <b>30</b> in which the seed gate <b>73</b> and is in the first position, seeds <b>21</b> are blocked from further downstream flow through the primary seed conduit <b>25</b> and directed to flow through the opening of the corresponding secondary seed conduit <b>27</b> and into the mini-hopper <b>65</b> at the respective row unit <b>15</b>.The second position is represented by the seed gate <b>73</b> shown in solid line at the right-most row unit <b>15</b>. In this second position, the seed gate <b>73</b> is fully closed, preventing seeds <b>21</b> to flow through the opening of the corresponding secondary seed conduit <b>27</b> at its junction <b>30</b>, directing all the seeds <b>21</b> to flow further downstream through the primary seed conduit <b>25</b> toward the next downstream row unit <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, this allows the control system <b>45</b> to control the seed gate system <b>71</b> to fill the mini-hoppers <b>65</b> at the row units <b>15</b>, sequentially one at a time by selectively commanding movements of the seed gates <b>73</b> between the open and closed first and second positions. The mini-hoppers <b>65</b> can be initially filled by releasing seeds <b>21</b> from the bulk fill hopper <b>33</b>, while the seed gate <b>73</b> is in the open first position at the first row unit <b>15</b>. When the signals from the seed level sensors <b>69</b> in the mini-hopper <b>65</b> of the first row unit <b>15</b> confirm that mini-hopper <b>65</b> is full or a less than full desired amount of seeds <b>21</b> has been received in the mini-hopper <b>65</b>, then the control system <b>45</b> commands closing of seed gate <b>73</b> at the first row unit in opening of the seed gate <b>73</b> at the second unit. At this point, seeds <b>21</b> bypass the first row unit by flowing across the closed seed gate <b>73</b> of the first row unit and are directed into the mini-hopper <b>65</b> at the second row unit. This continues until signals from the seed level sensors <b>69</b> in the in the mini-hopper <b>65</b> of the second row unit <b>15</b> confirm that the mini-hopper <b>65</b> is full or a less than full desired amount of seeds <b>21</b> has been received in the mini-hopper <b>65</b> of the second row unit <b>15</b>. The sequence is repeated for all row units <b>15</b>. During use of the planter <b>7</b><i>b</i>, the control system <b>45</b> interrogates the mini-hoppers <b>65</b> to evaluate fill levels based on signals from the seed level sensors <b>69</b> to determine which row units <b>15</b> require additional seed <b>21</b> and controls the seed delivery system <b>23</b> and the seed gate system <b>71</b> to maintain or provide appropriate seed levels in each of the mini-hoppers, based at least in part on the prescriptions map PM (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, in this embodiment, there is no seed gate system <b>71</b>, but instead separate delivery hoses, shown as the primary seed conduits <b>25</b>, extend from each of the primary delivery assemblies <b>39</b> for delivery of seeds <b>21</b> to each row unit <b>15</b>. In this way, each metering roller <b>41</b> feeds out the seed type <b>21</b><i>a</i>, <b>21</b><i>b</i>, <b>21</b><i>c</i>, <b>21</b><i>d </i>from its respective compartment <b>35</b> to a primary seed conduit <b>25</b> connected to each mini-hopper <b>65</b> at each row unit <b>15</b>.

In another embodiment as a variation of that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>b</i>, there is likewise no seed gate system <b>71</b>, but instead is a separate delivery hose or conduit that extends from each of the primary delivery assemblies <b>39</b> for delivery to a section of multiple row units <b>15</b>. In this way, each metering roller <b>41</b> feeds out the seed type <b>21</b><i>a</i>, <b>21</b><i>b</i>, <b>21</b><i>c</i>, <b>21</b><i>d </i>from its respective compartment <b>35</b> to a separate delivery hose or conduit that branches off to simultaneously feed a section of multiple mini-hoppers <b>65</b> multiple row units <b>15</b> within the same section of the planter <b>7</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref>, this embodiment is substantially the same as that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, differing in the following ways. The primary delivery assembly <b>39</b> does not use rollers <b>41</b> to release seed types <b>21</b><i>a</i>, <b>21</b><i>b</i>, <b>21</b><i>c</i>, <b>21</b><i>d </i>from their respective compartment(s) <b>35</b> toward the primary seed conduits <b>25</b>. Instead, an inductor system <b>42</b> controls the release of the seed types <b>21</b><i>a</i>, <b>21</b><i>b</i>, <b>21</b><i>c</i>, <b>21</b><i>d </i>from their respective compartment(s) <b>35</b> toward the primary seed conduits <b>25</b>. The inductor system <b>42</b> has a shut-off system <b>42</b><i>a </i>with a grate <b>42</b><i>b </i>having openings <b>42</b><i>c </i>that align with openings <b>42</b><i>d </i>of a sliding seed gate <b>42</b><i>e </i>when an actuator <b>42</b><i>f </i>moves the seed gate <b>42</b><i>e </i>to an open position, as represented in its solid line position in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>c </i>and as controlled by the control system <b>45</b>. When the seed gate <b>42</b><i>e </i>is in the open position, the seeds <b>21</b> flow out of the compartment(s) <b>35</b>, through the openings of the shut-off system <b>42</b><i>a </i>and into an inductor box <b>42</b><i>g </i>that receives air from the seed conveyance airflow system <b>19</b><i>a </i>and delivers an airflow with entrained seeds <b>21</b> through inductor outlets <b>42</b><i>h </i>and into the primary seed conduits <b>25</b>. When the actuator <b>42</b><i>f </i>moves the seed gate <b>42</b><i>e </i>to a closed position as represented in its dashed line position in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>c</i>, solid portions of the sliding seed gate <b>42</b><i>e </i>block the openings <b>42</b><i>c </i>of the grate <b>42</b><i>b </i>to close the shut-off system <b>42</b><i>a </i>and prevent flow of seeds <b>21</b> from the compartment(s) <b>35</b> inductor box <b>42</b><i>g </i>and thus stops delivery of seeds toward the row units <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4D</figref>, this embodiment is substantially similar to an implementation of the bulk storage system <b>31</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> and the on-row storage system <b>63</b> and seed meters <b>28</b><i>b </i>of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref>, differing in the following ways. The inductor system <b>42</b> is shown simplified, with the rollers <b>41</b> performing the main controlled release of seeds <b>21</b> from the compartments <b>35</b>.

The prescription map PM displays which type or variety zones VZ<b>1</b>, VZ<b>2</b>, VZ<b>3</b>, VZ<b>4</b> are located where in the agricultural field and which seed types <b>21</b><i>a</i>, <b>21</b><i>b</i>, <b>21</b><i>c</i>, <b>21</b><i>d </i>can be planted in the variety zones VZ<b>1</b>, VZ<b>2</b>, VZ<b>3</b>, VZ<b>4</b>.

<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> with further reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b>, and <b>5</b>, the method <b>101</b> is shown schematically for the control system <b>45</b> looking ahead to synchronize switching of seed types <b>21</b><i>a</i>, <b>21</b><i>b</i>, <b>21</b><i>c</i>, <b>21</b><i>d </i>delivered with the implement <b>7</b> crossing an inter-zone boundary B. As represented at block <b>103</b>, the implement <b>7</b> moves along a travel path. Control system <b>45</b> determines which zones VZ<b>1</b>, VZ<b>2</b>, VZ<b>3</b>, VZ<b>4</b> will be encountered by the implement <b>7</b> while moving along a travel path, as represented at block <b>105</b>.

In one embodiment, the travel path is defined in a path planning strategy selected by the operator. This can be selected or inputted by the operator through the tractor interface system <b>59</b>. The path planning strategy may provide a layover of the operator's desired travel path over a map of the field such as the prescriptions map PM (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>). For example, the operator can use the tractor interface system <b>59</b> input starting position of the implement <b>7</b> and/or tractor <b>9</b>, and define the travel path segments, including travel direction(s) and turn locations and direction(s), that collectively provide the overall path planning strategy for planting the entire field. Accordingly, the operator can select a predefined path planning strategy or enter a custom path planning strategy. Exemplary path planning strategies include an entirely back-and-forth travel strategy. This may including starting the implement <b>7</b> at a selected corner of the field and traveling and seeding or planting along adjacent back-and-forth travel segments along the entire length or width of the field, making 180&#xb0; turns at the headlands of the field, until the entire field has been seeded or planted. Other exemplary path planning strategies include initially seeding or planting the headlands, followed by a back-and-forth travel strategy. This may include starting the implement <b>7</b> at a selected corner of the field and traveling around the entire perimeter of the field, seeding or planting the headlands in a single perimeter lap around the field or more than one concentrically inwardly spiraling perimeter laps around the field. After the headlands are seeded or planted, the implement <b>7</b> may start at an unseeded or unplanted corner nearest the starting corner and seed or plant along adjacent back-and-forth travel segments along the entire width or length of the field, making 180&#xb0; turns at the headlands of the field, until the entire field has been seeded or planted. Other path planning strategies may include diagonal travel path segments, seeding or planting toward a middle portion of the field before other portions, or others. Regardless of the particular path planning strategy, the control system <b>45</b> uses the path planning strategy to make look-ahead predictions and control coordinated seed type delivery switchovers events for reducing mixing of different seed types during the switchover(s). If desired, the operator can change the path planning strategy during a seeding or planting session by inputting such changes through the tractor interface system <b>59</b> to redefine or revise the path planning strategy.

As represented at blocks <b>203</b> and <b>205</b>, the control system <b>45</b> looks ahead to determine what seed types <b>21</b><i>a</i>, <b>21</b><i>b</i>, <b>21</b><i>c</i>, <b>21</b><i>d </i>to plant in what order based on when the planter <b>7</b><i>b </i>and each of the individual row units <b>15</b> or sections will cross inter-zone boundaries B. The control system <b>45</b> refers to the operator's selected or defined path planning strategy as described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, equally applicable here, to make look-ahead predictions and issue corresponding control commands to the implement <b>7</b>. As represented at block <b>207</b>, based on a prescription map PM and path planning strategy, the control system <b>45</b> determines whether a single batch of seed <b>21</b>, such as by feeding enough seed <b>21</b> to fully fill the mini-hopper <b>65</b>. As represented at block <b>209</b>, if a single batch of seed <b>21</b> is determined to not provided enough seed for the planter <b>7</b><i>b </i>to reach the inter-zone boundary B, then the control system <b>45</b> commands feeding of seed <b>21</b> either continuously or by discrete batch delivery out of the bulk storage system <b>31</b>, as represented by blocks <b>211</b> and <b>213</b>. As represented at block <b>215</b>, the control system <b>45</b> reevaluates whether a single batch of seed <b>21</b> can provide enough seed <b>21</b> for the planter <b>7</b><i>b </i>to reach the inter-zone boundary B. As represented at block <b>217</b>, if the control system <b>45</b> determines that a single batch can provide enough seed <b>21</b> for the planter <b>7</b><i>b </i>to reach the inter-zone boundary B, then the control system <b>45</b> calculates an exact amount of the particular seed type <b>21</b><i>a</i>, <b>21</b><i>b</i>, <b>21</b><i>c</i>, <b>21</b><i>d </i>required to reach the inter-zone boundary B. As represented at blocks <b>219</b> and <b>221</b>, this can be based on, for example, values corresponding to distance remaining until reaching the inter-zone boundary B, time until reaching the inter-zone boundary B, and/or number of seeds <b>21</b> needed to reach the inter-zone boundary B. These values can be calculated by the control system <b>45</b> or stored in lookup tables within the control system <b>45</b>.

This may be done by activating the respective primary delivery assembly <b>39</b> to rotate the roller <b>41</b> for a duration of time or number of rotations that meters out the exact calibrated amount that was calculated as represented at block <b>225</b>. This may also be done by activating the respective primary delivery assembly <b>39</b> to rotate the roller <b>41</b> until the seed of the sensor <b>69</b> provide a signal indicative of the calculated amount being received in the mini-hoppers <b>65</b>, as represented at block <b>227</b>. As represented at blocks <b>229</b>, <b>231</b>, the control system <b>45</b> monitors how much seed <b>21</b> remains in the on-row storage system <b>63</b> and recalculates whether there is enough seed <b>21</b> in the on-row storage system <b>63</b> to reach the inter-zone boundary B, which may include evaluating signals from the seed level sensor <b>69</b> in the mini-hoppers <b>65</b>. If there is not enough seed <b>21</b> to reach the inter-zone boundary B, then a new calculation is made for the batch size according to block <b>217</b>. If there is enough seed <b>21</b> in the on-row storage system <b>63</b> to reach the inter-zone boundary B, then the control system <b>45</b> evaluates whether a seed switchover to a different seed type(s) <b>21</b><i>a</i>, <b>21</b><i>b</i>, <b>21</b><i>c</i>, <b>21</b><i>d </i>is needed at the inter-zone boundary B, as represented at block <b>233</b>. If a switchover to a different seed type(s) <b>21</b><i>a</i>, <b>21</b><i>b</i>, <b>21</b><i>c</i>, <b>21</b><i>d </i>is needed at the inter-zone boundary B, the control system <b>45</b> looks ahead to make boundary predictions as represented at block <b>203</b> and the process repeats.

<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Thus, in one embodiment, when the planter <b>7</b><i>b </i>first starts in the field, the bulk tank compartment <b>35</b> containing the seed type <b>21</b><i>a</i>, <b>21</b><i>b</i>, <b>21</b><i>c</i>, <b>21</b><i>d </i>that is to be planted first feeds the correct amount of seed <b>21</b> to each row unit <b>15</b> seed meter <b>28</b><i>b</i>.

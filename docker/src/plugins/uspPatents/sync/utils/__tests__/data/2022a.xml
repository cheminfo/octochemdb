<heading id="h-0002" level="1">Field of Technology</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present disclosure relates to agricultural tools that assist with gardening activities, more particularly gardening tools that can be used to remove weeds and plants from the ground.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">Description of Related Art</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Garden and agricultural tools require a user to use a significant amount of force to dig through soil. This may be necessary to cultivate, transplant plants, or remove unwanted weeds. When force is used to dig, there is a risk of severing the roots of the plants and weeds. This can damage the quality of a desired plant and, for weeds, does not allow the roots to be completely removed, allowing for the weeds to re-establish from the unremoved roots.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">To prevent severing of the roots, a garden tool may be used more deliberately and with less force, but this method is much slower and does not completely eliminate the possibility of severing roots.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Prior patents have attempted to solve this problem.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Japanese Patent Application Publication No. 2004/208675 discloses a long-handled shovel that uses a powered motor to linearly oscillate the shovel end to decrease the effort needed to dig. In this case, linear means in the direction of the long axis of the shovel body. The shovel uses the powered motor to increase the linear digging force. This force tends to sever plant roots, instead of removing them without disturbing the roots.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">United States Patent Application No. 2011/0083865 discloses a tool with a long body with a powered motor that applies lateral motion to the tool implement. The motor assists users with physically demanding tasks, but must be held with two hands.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present disclosure provides an agricultural tool, including a power supply and a motor wherein the motor supplies forced vibration to a tool implement. The power supply may include at least one of a cord and a battery. The tool implement may be at least one of a shovel, a spade, a hoe, a rake, a fork, a cultivator, a mattock, a pick, a post hole digger, an edger, a trowel, and a weeder. The vibration may be at least one of a linear vibration and rotational vibration, and preferably a combination of the two. The agricultural tool also includes a one-handed grip that allows for a user to assist gardening with a free hand. The grip may include a silicone cover to absorb vibration forces and to allow for easier handling.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present disclosure also provides an agricultural tool including a tool end, wherein a tool implement may be lockably connected to the tool end. The tool implement may be interchangeable, allowing for different tool implements to be used on the agricultural tool.</p>

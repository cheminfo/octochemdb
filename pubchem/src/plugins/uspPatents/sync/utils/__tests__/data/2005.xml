<heading level="2" id="d0e197">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="P-0001" num="0001"> The invention is directed to the field of children's wear and in particular to children's jeans incorporating auxiliary features providing play activities for the user. Children's clothing items having play facilities are, in general, known. For example, the Stocker, Jr. et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5,210,881 and Lawler U.S. Pat. No. 6,038,698 disclose shirts with special pockets for removable reception of toy animals. Stewart et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5,394,565 shows a jacket which, when removed from the wearer and placed flat on a support surface, forms a game-playing surface. The Kornbleuth U.S. Pat. No. 5,516,321 illustrates a sleeve construction incorporating a puppet feature at the end. The present invention represents a significant improvement over these representative types of garments in providing children's play features that are much more attractive and exciting to the user during play, while also imparting a novel and attractive appearance to the garment. </p>
<heading level="2" id="d0e208">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="P-0002" num="0002"> The invention relates to novelty jeans for children which, while having a basic child's jeans construction, incorporate a variety of interesting and attractive features enabling the user, while wearing the jeans, to have a variety of play outlets derived from special features incorporated in the jeans. </p>
<p id="P-0003" num="0003"> In one preferred form of the invention, sometimes referred to herein as &#x201c;racetrack&#x201d; jeans, one or both of the legs of the jeans may be provided with a contoured racetrack running generally vertically from top to bottom along the front of the leg, defining a racetrack for a toy race car, which preferably is provided as a package with the jeans. The jeans may be provided with a panel of fabric or other material spanning the defined track and secured to the jeans leg at opposite sides of the track, forming a tunnel through which the toy car can be driven by the user. In association with the defined racetrack, the jeans leg may be provided with a partially hidden, laterally opening &#x201c;pocket&#x201d;. The user can insert his or her hand into this &#x201c;pocket&#x201d; and invert it by pulling the pocket-defining pouch out through the pocket opening. The inside surface of the pocket-forming pouch carries a preprinted design, such as a black and white checkered design representative of a race flag, for example. All of the above described features are provided along the front portions of the jeans leg, where they are readily accessible to the wearer of the jeans, for play while the jeans are being worn. </p>
<p id="P-0004" num="0004"> In a particularly advantageous form of the above described &#x201c;race track&#x201d; jeans, the racetrack features may be provided on one leg, and a series of special pocket features provided on the opposite leg. The special pocket structure advantageously includes a first pocket of typical dimensions for receiving, among other things, the toy race car provided with the jeans. Preferably, that pocket is formed with a clear &#x201c;window&#x201d; panel, such that the toy car or other object is at least partially visible through the front wall of the pocket. Behind the first pocket is a &#x201c;secret&#x201d; pocket, which forms an internal tunnel extending well down the inside of the leg of the jeans and formed with an exit opening at or near the bottom of the pocket, such that, as a play feature, the toy car or other play object may be moved downward through the secret pocket and extracted through the lower opening. </p>
<p id="P-0005" num="0005"> In various of its forms, the novelty jeans of the invention may advantageously incorporate a convertible carry pouch, formed of fabric or other flexible material, which is removably carried on one of the legs of the jeans, preferably near the bottom. The pouch advantageously is formed of a single piece of material, provided with a main back panel and four foldable panels securable by Velcro or other hook and loop fastening elements. When closed by folding and securing the foldable panels over the front of the back panel, the pouch forms a container for play articles. When removed from the jeans leg, the pouch can be opened flat to provide a separate play surface. </p>
<p id="P-0006" num="0006"> In a further advantageous form of the invention, sometimes referred to herein as &#x201c;dollhouse&#x201d; jeans, a pair of child's jeans is advantegously provided with a variety of features suitable for playing with one or more small dolls, while the jeans are being worn by the child. In an illustrative form, the jeans can include on one leg a folded pouch, of the type generally described above, secured to a lower portion of the leg against a background of a dollhouse. Adjacent the bottom of the opposite leg, the jeans may be provided with an open top pocket in the form of, for example, a fence, providing a play pocket behind which a small doll can be placed and carried while being partly visible over the top of the fence. The dollhouse jeans also advantageously includes a special pocket structure including a &#x201c;secret&#x201d; tunnel pocket having an outlet at the bottom, and a window pocket in which a doll can be placed and viewed from the front. Features such as a laterally opening pocket, which converts into a flag or the like when withdrawn, can also be incorporated in the &#x201c;dollhouse&#x201d; jeans. </p>
<p id="P-0007" num="0007"> Yet another preferred embodiment of the invention incorporates special play features in the area of the knee portions of the jeans, including such features as a sliding curtain, which can be opened to reveal a &#x201c;stage&#x201d;, and hidden pockets containing finger puppets. The finger puppets can be activated by the user's hands, to be projected out of the hidden pockets and manipulated in front of the &#x201c;stage&#x201d;, all while the jeans are being worn by the user. </p>
<p id="P-0008" num="0008"> Some of the features generally described above can be mixed and matched, as can be appreciated. Additionally, the jeans can be provided with removable special pockets, containing or associated with additional dolls or animals, for example, such that highly attractive and exciting jeans sets may be provided. </p>
<p id="P-0009" num="0009"> For a more complete understanding of the above and other features and advantages of the invention, reference should be made to the following detailed description of preferred embodiments of the invention, and to the accompanying drawings.</p>

<heading level="2" id="d0e536">DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<p id="P-0030" num="0030"> Referring now to the drawings, and initially to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-8</figref> thereof, the reference numeral <b>30</b> designates generally a pair of children's jeans which may in many respects be of conventional construction, but are significantly modified pursuant to the invention. In the illustrated embodiment, the right leg <b>31</b> of the jeans is provided with a defined path <b>32</b> extending from the upper area of the leg in a serpentine pattern generally to the lower end of the leg. Preferably, this serpentine path is formed by attaching a separate layer of material, such as a layer of leather-like material <b>33</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) which is attached to the fabric material of the jeans leg <b>31</b>. In accordance with the invention, the defined path <b>32</b> forms a &#x201c;racetrack&#x201d;, on which the user of the jeans, while wearing them, may play with a small toy race car <b>34</b>, which is preferably marketed as part of the jeans sales item. </p>
<p id="P-0031" num="0031"> To advantage, a panel <b>35</b> of fabric or other material (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) is attached to the front of the jeans leg at spaced points <b>36</b> on opposite sides of the racetrack. This forms a tunnel <b>37</b> through which the car <b>34</b> may be driven during play. </p>
<p id="P-0032" num="0032"> In accordance with another aspect of the invention, the jeans are provided, in this case on the right leg <b>31</b>, with a special lateral pocket feature, designated generally by the reference numeral <b>38</b>, additional details of which are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. A pocket opening <b>39</b> is formed in the lower portion of the jeans leg <b>31</b>. However, the pocket is not designed to hold anything, and the pocket opening is oriented vertically. A pocket pouch <b>40</b> is secured around the edges of the pocket opening <b>39</b>. When not in &#x201c;use&#x201d; the pocket pouch <b>40</b> is positioned on the inside of the jeans leg <b>31</b>, in the manner indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. </p>
<p id="P-0033" num="0033"> Pursuant to the invention, the pocket pouch <b>40</b> is provided with decorative indicia (printed or otherwise) on the inside surface thereof. Thus, when the pocket is pulled inside out, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a decorative &#x201c;flag&#x201d; is displayed along an edge of the racetrack <b>32</b>. In the illustrated arrangement, the decorative flag advantageously is in the form of a checkered race flag, for example. When the child is through with a game's playing session, the pocket pouch <b>40</b> can be returned to its retracted and concealed position, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. </p>
<p id="P-0034" num="0034"> In accordance with another aspect of the invention, the play jeans are provided with novel pocket features which accommodate a variety of play action by the user of the jeans while wearing them. In the form of the invention illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the left leg <b>41</b> of the jeans is provided with a window pocket <b>42</b>, which is formed by securing a pocket panel <b>43</b> to the inside of the jeans leg (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). An opening <b>44</b> is formed in the front of the pocket, and this is closed off by a transparent window panel <b>45</b>. The user of the jeans thus can place the race car <b>34</b> or other associated toy into the window pocket, making it at least partially visible to play mates. </p>
<p id="P-0035" num="0035"> In the play jeans of the invention, a secret tunnel pocket is also provided in the left leg <b>41</b>, behind the window pocket <b>42</b>. This is formed by securing a vertically elongated panel of fabric <b>46</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) to the inside of the jeans leg <b>41</b>, extending from the main pocket opening <b>47</b> to a point well below the window pocket <b>42</b>, typically slightly above the knee. As indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the tunnel pocket <b>47</b> is closed at its lower end <b>48</b>. However, an opening <b>49</b> is provided at the lower extremity of the tunnel pocket. This allows a toy device <b>34</b>, inserted into the tunnel passage through the pocket opening <b>47</b> at the top, to be passed downwardly through the tunnel and removed through the lower opening <b>49</b>, all while wearing the jeans. </p>
<p id="P-0036" num="0036"> In a particularly preferred form, the play jeans of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> incorporate a carry pouch feature in the form of a small pouch <b>50</b> removably carried on the left jeans leg <b>41</b> near the bottom. Preferably, the pouch <b>50</b> is mounted against a patch of decorative background <b>51</b> attached to the front of the jeans leg and decorated appropriately according to the theme of the jeans, in this case in the form of a race flag. </p>
<p id="P-0037" num="0037"> The pouch <b>50</b>, shown in an open form in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, is comprised of a back panel <b>52</b> of generally rectangular form. The pouch is formed of flexible material, for example cloth, and includes end panels <b>53</b>, <b>54</b> extending from opposite side edges of the back panel, and upper and lower panels <b>55</b>, <b>56</b> extending from upper and lower edges respectively of the back panel <b>52</b>. To advantage, an inside panel <b>57</b> may be secured to the back panel <b>52</b> and end panels <b>53</b>, <b>54</b> to form separate pockets <b>58</b>-<b>60</b>. </p>
<p id="P-0038" num="0038"> The pouch is closed by folding the end panel <b>54</b> over the back panel <b>52</b> and then folding the opposite end panel <b>53</b>. The two end panels advantageously may be secured in their folded configuration by means of Velcro or other hook and loop fasteners <b>61</b>, <b>62</b>. The bottom panel <b>56</b> may then be folded upward over the folded end panels, and then the upper panel <b>55</b> folded down over the lower panel <b>57</b>. The upper and lower panels may be secured by suitable means, conveniently hook and loop fastener elements <b>63</b>, <b>64</b>. The folded pouch is illustrated in end view in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. </p>
<p id="P-0039" num="0039"> Desirably, the pouch <b>50</b> is removably attached to the jeans leg <b>41</b> to facilitate access. Additionally, when the pouch is removed and opened flat, it provides a separate play facility. Removal attachment can be accomplished by means of hook and loop fasteners (not shown) for example. In the preferred embodiment of the invention, however, the pouch is removably attached by means of an extended tongue <b>65</b> which is secured to the back panel <b>52</b> of the pouch and extends downward, generally as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>. The tongue <b>65</b> is made out of a material having some degree of stiffness. It may be fabric, in which case a stiffener material is incorporated within the structure of the tongue. A narrow deep pocket <b>66</b> is attached to the inside of the jeans leg <b>41</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, and is aligned with openings <b>67</b> in the jeans leg <b>41</b> and the decorative patch <b>51</b>. </p>
<p id="P-0040" num="0040"> For wear-around use, the pouch <b>50</b> is closed and the extended tongue <b>65</b> is inserted into the pocket <b>66</b>, mounting the pouch in the manner shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. It may be easily removed at any time by withdrawing the tongue <b>65</b> from the pocket <b>66</b>. It may be then carried as a closed pouch, or laid open in the manner shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> and used as a play surface or the like. For the latter use, the inside surfaces of the pouch may be suitably decorated. </p>
<p id="P-0041" num="0041"> The various features thus far described are incorporated in the racetrack jeans illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. However, as will be understood, and as will be made clear hereinafter, many of the features incorporated in the jeans of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, may be utilized as well in other types of jeans having other play themes. </p>
<p id="P-0042" num="0042"> In a second preferred embodiment of the invention, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9-13</figref>, a set of play jeans <b>70</b>, hereinafter referred to as dollhouse jeans, may be comprised in part of a set of standard children's blue jeans, modified and adapted in accordance with the invention. In the dollhouse jeans, the left jeans leg <b>71</b> advantageously is provided with a window pocket <b>72</b>, which can be of the same general construction as the window pocket <b>42</b> of the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> embodiment. For the dollhouse jeans, however, the window opening <b>73</b> advantageously is in the form of four small rectangular cut-outs, giving the sense of a house window with several window panes, and the outside of the pocket may be suitably decorated with curtains or other window treatments (not shown) for decorative purposes. </p>
<p id="P-0043" num="0043"> One or more doll <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 74</figref>, which may be marketed as a package with the jeans <b>70</b>, can be received in the window pocket <b>75</b> and are thus at least partially visible through window panes <b>76</b> formed of a clear material sewed onto the inside of the window pocket, in the manner of the clear panel <b>45</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. A secret tunnel pocket <b>77</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>) is provided behind the window pocket <b>75</b>, in the same manner as the secret tunnel pocket <b>47</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, provided in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. </p>
<p id="P-0044" num="0044"> Whereas the secret tunnel pocket of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is shown with a plain opening <b>49</b>, the tunnel pocket <b>77</b> of the dollhouse jeans advantageously may be provided with an opening <b>78</b> provided with a door flap <b>79</b> secured at one side and partially concealing the opening <b>78</b>. </p>
<p id="P-0045" num="0045"> At the bottom of the left jeans leg <b>71</b> there are provided one or more pocket compartments defined by a pocket front panel <b>80</b> attractively formed in the manner of a board fence. The panel <b>80</b> is secured along its side and bottom edges, forming one or more upwardly opening pocket compartments for the reception of doll FIGS. <b>81</b> or the like. </p>
<p id="P-0046" num="0046"> The right leg <b>82</b> of the dollhouse jeans is provided with a lateral pocket feature <b>83</b>. This corresponds in structure to the pocket feature <b>38</b> of the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> embodiment, in that a pocket pouch <b>84</b>, normally positioned inside the jeans leg <b>82</b>, can be pulled laterally outward and allowed to hang out in the form of a flag, substantially as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. The inside surface of the pocket pouch <b>84</b> is provided with suitable decorations <b>85</b>, which are visible when the pocket is turned &#x201c;inside out&#x201d; and displayed as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. </p>
<p id="P-0047" num="0047"> The lower portion of the jeans right leg <b>82</b> is suitably provided with a decorative patch <b>86</b>, appropriate to a dollhouse theme, which is secured to the front of the jeans leg material substantially in the manner of the decorative patch <b>51</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. In the instance of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the patch <b>86</b> may be in the shape of a house, for example. A carry pouch <b>87</b>, which can be similar in all structural respects to the carry pouch <b>50</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, is removably mounted to the lower jeans leg <b>82</b> substantially as described in connection with the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. </p>
<p id="P-0048" num="0048"> The embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> (as well as other embodiments of the invention) advantageously can incorporate removable play pocket features in various forms. In the form illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12, 13</figref>, a unit <b>90</b>, formed of fabric or the like is shaped in the form of a play doghouse and is associated as a package with a play dog or the like <b>91</b>. The play pocket <b>90</b> desirably has an opening <b>92</b> therein by which the play element <b>91</b> may be inserted between front and back panel elements <b>93</b>, <b>94</b> of the play pocket. </p>
<p id="P-0049" num="0049"> As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the back panel <b>94</b> of the play pocket has a plurality of hook and loop type elements <b>95</b> arranged for cooperation with corresponding elements <b>96</b> attached to the back face of the jeans left leg <b>71</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. The play pocket thus may be easily attached to and removed from the jeans as desired by the user. </p>
<p id="P-0050" num="0050"> As will be appreciated, the play pockets <b>90</b> may come in an endless variety of forms and shapes with various types of play elements <b>91</b> associated therewith, and may be changed on a periodic basis by the user. </p>
<p id="P-0051" num="0051"> Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14-20</figref> of the drawings, there is shown a pair of novelty jeans incorporating concealed puppet play features which enable the user, while wearing the jeans, to perform a puppet show display. The reference numeral <b>100</b> designates generally children's novelty play jeans having legs <b>101</b>, <b>102</b> incorporating built-in play facilities <b>103</b>, <b>104</b> respectively, advantageously spanning the area of the knees from slightly above to slightly below the position of the user's knees when the jeans are worn. Each of the play facilities is generally in the form of a pocket, which is closed along the bottom <b>105</b>, <b>106</b> and open at the top <b>107</b>, <b>108</b>. The respective play facilities <b>103</b>, <b>104</b> advantageously span at least about half way around the respective legs of the jeans <b>101</b>, <b>102</b>, embracing the front portions thereof. </p>
<p id="P-0052" num="0052"> Adjacent the upper edge of each of the pockets, there is provided a curtain band <b>109</b>, <b>110</b> which slideably supports a curtain <b>111</b>, <b>112</b>. Underneath the curtains, there is advantageously printed or sewed-on decoration <b>113</b> depicting a play stage. </p>
<p id="P-0053" num="0053"> The pocket structures of the respective play facilities <b>103</b>, <b>104</b> include not only the top openings <b>107</b>, <b>108</b>, but also intermediate openings <b>114</b>, <b>115</b>. Secured to the insides of the pocket structures are partial gloves <b>116</b>, which are normally retained within the pocket structures, but can be projected out through the openings <b>114</b>, <b>115</b> by insertion of the hand into the upper openings <b>107</b>, <b>108</b> of the pockets and then into the partial gloves <b>116</b>, in the manner indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, for example. </p>
<p id="P-0054" num="0054"> At the outer end extremities of the partial glove <b>116</b>, there are individual finger puppet elements <b>117</b>, which can be manipulated by fingers of a hand inserted within the partial glove, as reflected in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, for example. </p>
<p id="P-0055" num="0055"> For normal wear of the jeans, the curtains <b>111</b>, <b>112</b> are normally moved to &#x201c;closed&#x201d; positions, as shown at the left in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> and at the right in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>. The partial gloves <b>116</b> will have been drawn inwardly through the respective pocket openings <b>114</b>, <b>115</b> and are contained within internal pockets. The user of the jeans can display a puppet show, typically from a seated position as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18, 19</figref>. For this purpose, the curtains <b>111</b>, <b>112</b> are slid laterally to their respective open positions, where they can be secured by means of a snap together strap arrangement <b>118</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>). The child then inserts one or both hands into the open upper ends <b>107</b>, <b>108</b> of the pocket structures and into the partial gloves <b>116</b>. The gloves and their respective puppets are projected out through the intermediate pocket openings <b>114</b>, <b>115</b> to display the puppets and enable them to be manipulated in a desired manner. </p>
<p id="P-0056" num="0056"> If desired, a finger puppet <b>119</b> may also be provided in connection with an upper pocket <b>120</b>, projectable through an intermediate pocket opening <b>121</b> by a retractable partial glove <b>122</b> engagable from inside the pocket. </p>
<p id="P-0057" num="0057"> As will be understood, various of the play features herein described may be mixed and combined in a wide variety of ways to provide attractive, stimulating jeans which incorporate play features usable while the jeans are being worn. </p>
<p id="P-0058" num="0058"> It should be understood, of course, that the specific forms of the invention herein illustrated and described are intended to be representative only, as certain changes may be made therein without departing from the clear teachings of the disclosure. Accordingly, reference should be made to the following appended claims in determining the full scope of the invention. </p>

<heading level="2" id="d0e185">FIELD OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="P-0001" num="0001"> This invention concerns a garment featuring means for temporarily attaching a clothing accessory, and more particularly a garment intended to be worn when playing golf, such as a skirt or trousers. </p>
<heading level="2" id="d0e196">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="P-0002" num="0002"> It is common for golfers to wear a glove on one hand to hold their clubs when playing golf. But for precision shots, however, they often prefer to remove their glove in order to have better tactile sensation on the club. The problem they face in this case is to find somewhere to put the removed glove so that it is close by once they have played the shot. It is not unusual for the removed glove to be placed on the golfing trolley, with the risk of having difficulty in finding it or of it falling onto the ground. More commonly the glove is partly inserted into a trouser pocket, but this is neither practical nor aesthetic, and here again the glove risks falling onto the ground and getting dirty. Furthermore, a glove that is put in a pocket does not get aired, and can be uncomfortable to put back on if damp with perspiration. </p>
<heading level="2" id="d0e207">BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<p id="P-0003" num="0003"> The aim of this invention is to overcome these problems. </p>
<p id="P-0004" num="0004"> With these objectives in mind, the subject of the invention is a garment, such as a skirt, culottes, dress, pair of trousers, shorts, bermuda shorts or similar article, featuring means for temporarily attaching a clothing accessory such as a glove, characterized in that the said means feature press studs of which the male or female elements are attached permanently to the garment in a place that is readily accessible to the hand of the person wearing the garment, and a piece of self-adhering fabric associated permanently or temporarily with the garment in the said area, and the said means are arranged such that the said press stud elements allow the piece of self-adhering fabric to be either exposed in order to attach the clothing accessory, or covered so that the piece of self-adhering fabric is concealed from view. </p>
<p id="P-0005" num="0005"> The inventors have in effect observed that golfing gloves, as the clothing accessories for which the invention is essentially intended, almost always feature a self-adhering strip-fastening system of the type generally known under the name Velcro&#xae; on the side corresponding to the back of the hand near the wrist. More precisely, the glove features a movable flap with a self-adhering strip that can be placed on a fixed part of the glove, which in turn also features a self-adhering strip situated roughly on the back of the hand. This enables the glove to be fitted on the hand as snugly as possible, without any possibility of it slipping when gripping the clubs during the game, and moreover this attaching system can be easily undone in order to remove the glove. </p>
<p id="P-0006" num="0006"> The inventors then imagined using this self-adhering fabric system, and more particularly the element situated on the fixed part of the glove, to temporarily attach the removed glove to the garment worn by the golfer, preferably in a place that is as readily accessible as possible and in no way hampers the golfer movements when playing the shot. The preferred place is located on the back of the garment, approximately on the buttock, at the point where the back pocket is commonly located on a pair of trousers, for example. In addition, this place particularly readily accessible, does not hamper the movements of the golfer, and consequently a glove that is attached there is very unlikely to become detached or fall onto the ground. Moreover, as the glove is placed entirely on the outside of the garment, airing is optimal which brings increased comfort when the player puts the glove back on. </p>
<p id="P-0007" num="0007"> In a first embodiment of the invention, the garment features at least two male or female press stud elements and the piece of self-adhering fabric features two counterpart male or female press stud elements positioned the same distance from each other as the press stud elements on the garment, such that the said piece of self-adhering fabric can be attached temporarily to the garment by means of the said press studs. </p>
<p id="P-0008" num="0008"> Thus, during a game of golf, the player attaches the piece of self-adhering fabric to his or her garment by means of the press studs, thereby enabling the glove to be readily attached to or removed from the self-adhering fabric. Before or after the game, the piece of self-adhering fabric can be removed and the press stud elements fixed permanently on the garment can be concealed by complementary decorative elements furnished with the garment so that it can be given a more aesthetic appearance, and can be worn for everyday purposes. In addition, the said complementary decorative elements can have characteristics such as shape or color which, as well as concealing the press studs on the garment, could also constitute a recognizable sign specific to the garment manufacturer or the person wearing it. </p>
<p id="P-0009" num="0009"> The garment will preferably feature a pocket in which to keep the piece of self-adhering fabric or the decorative elements when not being used. </p>
<p id="P-0010" num="0010"> In another embodiment, the piece of self-adhering fabric is sewn onto the garment, and the garment features a flap positioned such that it covers and conceals the piece of self-adhering fabric when in the folded down position and uncovers the said piece of self-adhering fabric when in the raised position, where it is maintained on the garment by temporary attaching means. </p>
<p id="P-0011" num="0011"> With this embodiment, the piece of self-adhering fabric for attaching the glove is fixed permanently to the garment. When the flap is down, it aesthetically conceals the piece of self-adhering fabric, and when it is kept raised in the playing position this enables the glove to be readily attached to or detached from the self-adhering fabric. </p>
<p id="P-0012" num="0012"> When the flap is in the down position, it is preferably held against the garment by two press studs positioned one on either side of the piece of self-adhering fabric. This arrangement keeps the flap perfectly in position to hide the piece of self-adhering fabric when the garment is worn off the golf course as town wear. </p>
<p id="P-0013" num="0013"> In another arrangement of the invention, the said means of temporary attachment for maintaining the flap in the raised position features at least one press stud of which one element, male or female, is fixed to the flap and its counterpart element is fixed to the garment above the flap. The press stud will preferably be centrally positioned on the flap. </p>
<p id="P-0014" num="0014"> Preferably, the garment shall be furnished with removable decorative male or female press studs elements, complementary to the elements fixed on the flap and above the flap respectively, so that they can be placed on the said elements that are fixed permanently to the garment when the flap is in the down position. Thus, when the flap is folded down, all the visible parts of the press studs will be covered by these decorative elements. </p>
<p id="P-0015" num="0015"> Other characteristics and advantages of the invention will appear in the following description of the two methods of producing the invention.</p>

<p id="P-0022" num="0022"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows the different elements of the system, by way of example: </p>
<p id="P-0023" num="0023"> the pair of trousers <b>1</b> on which two male press stud elements <b>11</b> are attached in the rear right-hand zone at buttock level. </p>
<p id="P-0024" num="0024"> the piece of self-adhering fabric <b>2</b>, Velcro&#xae; strip type on which are fixed two female press stud elements <b>21</b>, positioned such that they clip into the male elements <b>11</b> situated on the trousers, given that the same system can be adapted to any other garment such as a skirt, dress, pair of shorts, etc. </p>
<p id="P-0025" num="0025"> the glove <b>3</b>, which in the conventional manner features a Velcro&#xae; patch that is normally intended to receive the flap of the glove <b>32</b>, and which can adhere to the piece of self-adhering fabric <b>2</b>. </p>
<p id="P-0026" num="0026"> two decorative caps <b>41</b> consisting of female press stud elements and designed to be fitted onto the male elements <b>11</b> when the trousers are to be worn as town wear. </p>
<p id="P-0027" num="0027"> On <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> the trousers are shown in the playing position, with the piece of Velcro&#xae; <b>2</b> held in place by the press studs <b>21</b> clipped into elements <b>11</b>. The arrow F shows the way in which the glove will be attached to the trousers by its piece of Velcro&#xae; <b>31</b> adhering to the piece of Velcro&#xae; <b>2</b> fixed on the trousers, such that it is held there as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. </p>
<p id="P-0028" num="0028"> In the aesthetic town wear configuration, the caps <b>41</b> replace the removable piece of Velcro&#xae; <b>2</b> and conceal the male elements of the press studs fixed permanently on the trousers. Other press stud caps can be added to the previous two to further enhance the aesthetic appearance or to give the trousers a particular style when intended for town wear. </p>
<p id="P-0029" num="0029"> In the second method of producing the invention, the piece of Velcro&#xae; <b>2</b>&#x2032; is sewn onto the trousers, skirt or similar garment, in more or less the same place as is indicated for the first method of production. </p>
<p id="P-0030" num="0030"> A flap <b>5</b> on the garment, similar to a conventional pocket flap, covers the piece of Velcro&#xae; <b>2</b>&#x2032; when in the town wear position. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows the flap <b>5</b> in the down position where it conceals the piece of Velcro&#xae;, and shows just two fixed decorative caps <b>51</b> of the side press studs and two removable decorative caps, one a male element <b>62</b> clipped into the female element <b>52</b> fixed in the center of the flap, the other a female element <b>63</b> clipped into the male element <b>53</b> fixed on the garment above the flap. The male <b>53</b> and female <b>52</b> elements are moreover positioned such that they clip into each other to hold the flap in the raised position as shown in FIGS. <b>7</b> to <b>9</b>. </p>
<p id="P-0031" num="0031"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows the flap in the down position but with the two decorative caps <b>62</b> and <b>63</b> removed to prepare for the flap to be put in the raised position. The two male <b>53</b> and female <b>52</b> elements of the central press stud are visible in this case. </p>
<p id="P-0032" num="0032"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows the flap <b>5</b> raised leaving the piece of Velcro&#xae; <b>2</b>&#x2032; accessible, with two female press stud elements <b>54</b> on either side of it. The underside of raised flap thus made visible features two male elements <b>56</b> corresponding to caps <b>51</b> and positioned such that they clip into the female elements <b>54</b>. </p>
<p id="P-0033" num="0033"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> reproduces <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> but illustrates the attaching of the glove by sticking its Velcro&#xae; strip <b>31</b> onto the piece of Velcro&#xae; <b>2</b>&#x2032; such that the glove is held in place as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. </p>
<p id="P-0034" num="0034"> While playing golf, the flap <b>5</b> can thus remain in the raised position, allowing the glove to be readily attached or removed. Once the game of golf is over, the flap is brought down over the Velcro&#xae; and held closed by clipping in press studs <b>54</b> and <b>56</b>. The aesthetic appearance of the flap can then be enhanced by clipping in the two removable caps <b>62</b> and <b>63</b>. </p>
<p id="P-0035" num="0035"> The invention is not limited to the two methods of fabrication described above purely for the purpose of example. More specifically, the male and female elements of the press studs can be reversed. The shape of the pieces of Velcro&#xae; and of the flap can be changed. The invention can be applied to golfing garments other than trousers, as was mentioned earlier. </p>

<p id="P-0003" num="0003"> This section describes the technical field in more detail, and discusses problems encountered in the technical field. This section does not describe prior art as defined for purposes of anticipation or obviousness under 35 U.S.C. section 102 or 35 U.S.C. section 103. Thus, nothing stated in the Statement of a Problem Addressed by This Invention is to be construed as prior art </p>
<p id="P-0004" num="heading-0004"> Discussion </p>
<p id="P-0005" num="0005"> Thongs were introduced in about 1939 and their use has increased in popularity ever since. Also, within the last two decades tight clothing has become more popular and thongs help hide panty lines underneath tight clothing. </p>
<p id="P-0006" num="0006"> Unfortunately, users have a love/hate relationship with thongs. They love the way thongs hide panty lines. However, they hate the discomfort caused by thong creep. Thongs with narrow rear portions often wedge between the buttocks and irritate sensitive areas, such as skin within the natal cleft, and perineum. In addition to discomfort, thongs can also lead to discomfort and medical problems such as vaginal and urinary tract infections, irritation of the rectum, hemorrhoids, and tiny lacerations. Most of the more severe medical problems are caused by the narrow rear portion of a thong sliding back and forth spreading bacteria from the perianal region to the genital area. </p>
<heading level="2" id="d0e185">SELECTED OVER VIEW OF SELECTED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<p id="P-0007" num="0007"> This invention provides technical advantages as a comfort strip that controls under pant garments from becoming wedged within the declivity formed by the buttocks. The comfort strip reduces discomfort and medical problems associated with under pant garment fabric chaffing and scratching against sensitive skin within the natal cleft, and perineum. Preferably, the comfort strip is generally trapezoidal in cross section with a vertical configuration when coupled to a thong, or alternatively comprises at least one horizontal strip. Either embodiment stops thong creep. </p>
<p id="P-0008" num="0008"> The vertical comfort strip comprises a top portion, a bottom portion, and a pair of opposing side portions. The top portion is adapted to conform to the natal cleft, or perineum, or both regions in part or whole. The bottom portion is adapted to attach to an under pant garment. The bottom portion is coupled to the top portion via a pair of opposing side portions. The opposing side portions are, in one embodiment, symmetrical in shape. In one embodiment, the comfort strip may be a generally symmetrical wedge that is permanently attached to an under pant garment via sewing. In an alternative embodiment, the comfort strip may be at least one removably attached horizontal bands adapted to attach to a rear portion of an under pant garment. Preferably, the comfort strip is composed of a semi-rigid material that has a &#x201c;memory&#x201d; to such that it retains its shape. </p>
<p id="P-0009" num="0009"> Of course, other features and embodiments of the invention will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art. After reading the specification, and the detailed description of the exemplary embodiment, these persons will recognize that similar results can be achieved in not dissimilar ways. Accordingly, the detailed description is provided as an example of the best mode of the invention, and it should be understood that the invention is not limited by the detailed description. Accordingly, the invention should be read as being limited only by the claims. </p>

<heading level="2" id="d0e299">AN EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENT OF A BEST MODE </heading>
<p id="P-0019" num="heading-0019"> Interpretation Considerations </p>
<p id="P-0020" num="0020"> When reading this section (An Exemplary Embodiment of a Best Mode, which describes an exemplary embodiment of the best mode of the invention, hereinafter &#x201c;exemplary embodiment&#x201d;), one should keep in mind several points. First, the following exemplary embodiment is what the inventor believes to be the best mode for practicing the invention at the time this patent was filed. Thus, since one of ordinary skill in the art may recognize from the following exemplary embodiment that substantially equivalent structures or substantially equivalent acts may be used to achieve the same results in exactly the same way, or to achieve the same results in a not dissimilar way, the following exemplary embodiment should not be interpreted as limiting the invention to one embodiment. </p>
<p id="P-0021" num="0021"> Likewise, individual aspects (sometimes called species) of the invention are provided as examples, and, accordingly, one of ordinary skill in the art may recognize from a following exemplary structure (or a following exemplary act) that a substantially equivalent structure or substantially equivalent act may be used to either achieve the same results in substantially the same way, or to achieve the same results in a not dissimilar way. </p>
<p id="P-0022" num="0022"> Accordingly, the discussion of a species (or a specific item) invokes the genus (the class of items) to which that species belongs as well as related species in that genus. Likewise, the recitation of a genus invokes the species known in the art. Furthermore, it is recognized that as technology develops, a number of additional alternatives to achieve an aspect of the invention may arise.

<p id="P-0001" num="0001"> 1. Field </p>
<p id="P-0002" num="0002"> The present invention relates generally to removal of odors from the air and, in particular, to ventilation of toilets to remove unpleasant odors from areas surrounding the toilets. </p>
<p id="P-0003" num="0003"> 2. Description of the Related Art </p>
<p id="P-0004" num="0004"> A variety of devices and techniques currently exist and are employed to remove unpleasant odors from toilets and areas surrounding a toilet commonly referred to as water closets. An old but common technique is to locate the water closet along an outer wall of a house or building and provide one or more windows for ventilating the air in the water closet. One drawback to this technique is that the unpleasant odors are allowed to permeate throughout the water closet before exiting through the open window. Another drawback is that space along an outer wall is usually limited and it may not be possible to locate the water closet along an outer wall. </p>
<p id="P-0005" num="0005"> A common solution to removing the odors from a water closet without access to an exterior wall is to use a ventilation fan. The ventilation fan can be located in the ceiling of the water closet and ventilation pipes or ducts can vent the air to the exterior of the house or to another area of the house (i.e., typically, the attic). A drawback to this technique is that the unpleasant odors are still allowed to permeate throughout the water closet. Because the odors are permitted to permeate throughout the water closet, the unpleasant odors may linger even after the fan is deactivated, window is closed, or the water closet is vacated. </p>
<p id="P-0006" num="0006"> Another common solution is to provide and use solid and/or aerosol air fresheners. A drawback is that the air fresheners emit a scent to &#x201c;mask&#x201d; the unpleasant odor and, typically, the unpleasant odor is only masked for a short period of time. Moreover, the mixture of the emitted scent and the unpleasant odor may result in yet another undesirable odor. Finally, aerosol spray dispensers have been shown to have undesirable affects. </p>
<p id="P-0007" num="0007"> More recently, various ventilation devices have been developed for removing the odor from in and around toilets. Many of these are portable devices designed to attach to the rear of the toilet seat. These devices typically have several external attachments which makes them unsightly when attached to the toilet seat and hard to keep sanitary. Furthermore, these portable devices may not be suited for use with all toilets. Certain ventilation devices have been built into the seat or otherwise incorporated into the toilet. These devices entail the use of many parts, typically custom manufactured parts, which increases the cost of the toilets, the complexity of the toilets and the workings of the toilets and the ventilation device, and the difficulty in manufacturing and maintaining the toilets. Moreover, many of these devices require the use of electricity near the toilet, which introduces a potential hazard to its user. </p>

<p id="P-0024" num="0024"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a side elevation of one embodiment of an integrated toilet and air deodorizer <b>10</b>, according to the present invention. As depicted, integrated toilet and air deodorizer <b>10</b> comprises a bowl <b>102</b> mounted on and coupled to a supporting pedestal <b>104</b>, which generally extends downwardly from bowl <b>102</b>. A water tank <b>106</b> is also mounted to pedestal <b>104</b> beyond the rear portion of bowl <b>102</b>. Bowl <b>102</b> includes a flush ring <b>108</b> near its rim and flush ring <b>108</b> comprises a plurality of water discharge openings facing inwardly into bowl <b>102</b>. Flush ring <b>108</b> is coupled to water tank <b>106</b> and operates to discharge water from water tank <b>106</b> into bowl <b>102</b> via the plurality of water discharge openings. Stated another way, the water from tank <b>106</b> travels or passes through flush ring <b>108</b> and into bowl <b>102</b>. </p>
<p id="P-0025" num="0025"> Bowl <b>102</b> is coupled to a discharge passage <b>110</b> at a discharge opening located toward the bottom section of bowl <b>102</b>, and discharge passage <b>110</b> leads to a discharge outlet <b>112</b> to which is connected a sewer waste drain. Bowl <b>102</b>, pedestal <b>104</b>, water tank <b>106</b>, flush ring <b>108</b>, discharge passage <b>110</b>, and discharge outlet <b>112</b>&#x2032; are basically standard and operate in a manner substantially similar to comparable components found in conventional toilets and, as such, will not be further discussed herein. </p>
<p id="P-0026" num="0026"> As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the present invention provides for the ventilation and removal of foul and unpleasant odors through an air passageway <b>114</b>. Air passageway <b>114</b> is generally located above flush ring <b>108</b> at the rim of bowl <b>102</b> and extends about the periphery of bowl <b>102</b>. Air passageway <b>114</b> is an upward extension of the rim of bowl <b>102</b> and, thus, is integrated into and forms an integral part of integrated toilet and air deodorizer <b>10</b>. Air passageway <b>114</b> comprises a continuous orifice facing inwardly into bowl <b>102</b> and also extending about the periphery of bowl <b>102</b>. </p>
<p id="P-0027" num="0027"> Air passageway <b>114</b> extends to a neck <b>116</b> at substantially the rear portion of bowl <b>102</b> between bowl <b>102</b> and water tank <b>106</b>. Neck <b>116</b> is coupled to a curvilinear exhaust pipe <b>118</b>, which extends downwardly and rearwardly from neck <b>116</b> to an aperture <b>120</b>, thus, forming a passage from air passageway <b>114</b> to aperture <b>120</b> via neck <b>116</b> and exhaust pipe <b>118</b>. Much like air passageway <b>114</b>, exhaust pipe <b>118</b> is integrated into and forms an integral part of integrated toilet and air deodorizer <b>10</b>. </p>
<p id="P-0028" num="0028"> Exhaust pipe <b>118</b> comprises a drain hole <b>122</b> positioned between the rear of pedestal <b>104</b> and aperture <b>120</b>. Drain hole <b>122</b> may be used for draining the contents of exhaust pipe <b>118</b> and, in normal operation, is maintained in a closed position by the use of a screw-like drain plug that fits into and seals drain hole <b>122</b>. For example, if and when integrated toilet and air deodorizer <b>10</b> overflows, thus causing water to enter air exhaust pipe <b>118</b> via air passageway <b>114</b>, drain hole <b>122</b> may be opened to drain the trapped water. </p>
<p id="P-0029" num="0029"> A seat <b>124</b> and an optional bowl cover (not shown) are pivotally mounted to integrated toilet and air deodorizer <b>10</b> between bowl <b>102</b> and water tank <b>106</b>. In a lowered position, seat <b>124</b> rests upon air passageway <b>114</b> and functions to provide a surface upon which a human user can position him or herself while utilizing integrated toilet and air deodorizer <b>10</b>. </p>
<p id="P-0030" num="0030"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a side elevation of one embodiment of integrated toilet and air deodorizer <b>10</b> coupled to a conduit <b>202</b> being within an adjacent wall <b>204</b>, according to the present invention. As depicted, integrated toilet and air deodorizer <b>10</b> is positioned near and in front of wall <b>204</b>. Exhaust pipe <b>118</b> is coupled to a distal end of conduit <b>202</b> at aperture <b>120</b>. Conduit <b>202</b> extends away from its coupling to exhaust pipe <b>118</b> into and upwardly within wall <b>204</b>. Conduit <b>120</b> is suitable for transporting the gaseous contents contained within conduit <b>120</b>, for example, from the distal end coupled to exhaust pipe <b>118</b> to the distal end opposite exhaust pipe <b>118</b>. </p>
<p id="P-0031" num="0031"> A conventional exhaust fan (not shown) is built into wall <b>204</b> and, at one side, is coupled to the distal end of conduit <b>204</b> opposite the connection to exhaust pipe <b>118</b>. The other side of the exhaust fan is coupled to another conduit (not shown) that provides access to an area outside and away from a water closet housing integrated toilet and air deodorizer <b>10</b> and, preferably, outside of the building or structure in which integrated toilet and air deodorizer <b>10</b> is located. A switch (not shown) is coupled to a power supply and the exhaust fan and operates to activate the exhaust fan. When activated, the exhaust fan operates to draw the foul and unpleasant odors from within and around bowl <b>102</b> through air passageway <b>114</b>, neck <b>116</b>, aperture <b>118</b>, and conduit <b>202</b> through the exhaust fan and out into the atmosphere, away from integrated toilet and air deodorizer <b>10</b> and its user. </p>
<p id="P-0032" num="0032"> One technical advantage of integrated toilet and air deodorizer <b>10</b> is provided by the placement of air passageway <b>114</b> above flush ring <b>108</b>. Because air passageway <b>114</b> is located above flush ring <b>108</b>, air passageway <b>114</b> does not interfere with the standard toilet functions of integrated toilet and air deodorizer <b>10</b>. In particular, air passageway <b>114</b> does not interfere with the flushing of the contents of bowl <b>102</b> through discharge passage <b>110</b> and out discharge outlet <b>112</b> as a result of the delivery of water from water tank <b>106</b> to bowl <b>102</b> through flush ring <b>108</b>. </p>
<p id="P-0033" num="0033"> Another technical advantage of integrated toilet and air deodorizer <b>10</b> is provided by air passageway <b>114</b> being an upward extension of bowl <b>102</b>. This provides for an aesthetic integrated toilet and air deodorizer <b>10</b> in that there are no bulky or numerous attachments that need to be fitted to the toilet and which makes the toilet unsightly. Furthermore, air passageway <b>114</b> is a clean and simple design and extension of the rim of bowl <b>102</b>, and does not increase the complexity and workings of integrated toilet and air deodorizer <b>10</b> beyond that of conventional toilets. </p>
<p id="P-0034" num="0034"> Yet another technical advantage of integrated toilet and air deodorizer <b>10</b> is provided by the continuous orifice of air passageway <b>114</b> that faces inwardly into bowl <b>102</b> and extends about the periphery of bowl <b>102</b>. This feature permits air passageway <b>114</b> to draw the unpleasant odors from within bowl <b>102</b> from all directions (i.e., front, sides, and rear of bowl <b>102</b>) about the periphery of bowl <b>102</b>. This significantly increases the drawing capability of air passageway <b>114</b>, and enables integrated toilet and air deodorizer <b>10</b> to remove the foul and unpleasant odors before these odors escape from within bowl <b>102</b> and permeate the surrounding atmosphere. Furthermore, when a user is seated upon seat <b>124</b>, the drawing (i.e., suction) capability of air passageway <b>114</b> is further enhanced due the vacuum-like effect caused by the blockage of the top of bowl <b>102</b> cause by the presence of the user seated upon seat <b>124</b>. </p>
<p id="P-0035" num="0035"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates a rear elevation of one embodiment of integrated toilet and air deodorizer <b>10</b>, according to the present invention. As depicted, integrated toilet and air deodorizer <b>10</b> comprises two exhaust pipes <b>118</b><i>a </i>and <b>118</b><i>b </i>that converge at aperture <b>120</b>. Exhaust pipe <b>118</b><i>a </i>extends from neck <b>116</b> down one side of integrated toilet and air deodorizer <b>10</b> below water tank <b>106</b> and behind bowl <b>102</b> to aperture <b>120</b>. Exhaust pipe <b>118</b><i>b </i>extends from neck <b>116</b> down the other side (opposite the side on which exhaust pipe <b>118</b><i>a </i>extends) of integrated toilet and air deodorizer <b>10</b> below water tank <b>106</b> and behind bowl <b>102</b> to aperture <b>120</b>. In another embodiment, integrated toilet and air deodorizer <b>10</b> can be composed of a exhaust pipe <b>118</b> that extends from neck <b>116</b> down one of the sides of integrated toilet and air deodorizer <b>10</b> to aperture <b>120</b>. </p>
<p id="P-0036" num="0036"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates a partial cross-section of a front elevation of one embodiment of toilet bowl <b>102</b> and pedestal <b>104</b>, according to the present invention. As depicted, bowl <b>102</b> extends upwardly at its rim beyond flush ring <b>108</b> to form an exterior side of air passageway <b>114</b>. The upper section of flush ring <b>108</b> forms the lower section of air passageway <b>114</b> and the upper section of air passageway <b>114</b> forms the ledge of bowl <b>102</b>. The upper section of air passageway <b>114</b> forms a suitable surface for receiving and supporting seat <b>124</b> when seat <b>124</b> is in a lowered position. </p>
<p id="P-0037" num="0037"> The upper section of air passageway <b>114</b> extends away from the exterior side of air passageway <b>114</b> and inwardly into bowl <b>102</b> in a generally horizontal direction before folding over and extending in a generally downward direction into bowl <b>102</b> to form an inner side section of the rim of bowl <b>102</b> (i.e., the inner side of air passageway <b>114</b>). In this manner, a continuous orifice between the inner side of flush ring <b>108</b> and the inner side of air passageway <b>114</b>. This is better illustrated by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, which illustrates a partial cross-sectional view of one embodiment of an arcuate air passageway <b>114</b> of integrated toilet and air deodorizer <b>10</b>, according to the present invention. As is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the orifice leads to a generally L-shaped cavity that is formed by the four sides of air passageway <b>114</b> and the inner side of flush ring <b>108</b>. </p>
<p id="P-0038" num="0038"> It is appreciated that the thickness of the sides of air passageway <b>114</b> and, in particular, the thickness of the exterior side of air passageway <b>114</b> needs to be sufficient to provide stability for air passageway <b>114</b> to support seat <b>124</b> in a lowered position atop air passageway <b>114</b> and a user situated upon seat <b>124</b>. The thickness depends on factors such as, by way of example and without limitation, the length of the exterior side of air passageway <b>114</b>, the shape of the sides of air passageway <b>114</b>, the structural characteristics of the material used in making integrated toilet and air deodorizer <b>10</b>, and the like. </p>
<p id="P-0039" num="0039"> It is also appreciated that the lengths of the sides of air passageway <b>114</b> determine the size of the cavity composed by the sides of air passageway <b>114</b>. Moreover, the size of the orifice of air passageway <b>114</b> is determined by the difference between the length of the upper section of air passageway <b>114</b> and the sum of the length of the lower section of air passageway <b>114</b> and the thickness of the inner side of air passageway <b>114</b>. The size of the cavity and the orifice work in conjunction to create the drawing or suction capability of integrated toilet and air deodorizer <b>10</b>. </p>
<p id="P-0040" num="0040"> With this in mind, in one embodiment, the upper section of air passageway <b>114</b> is approximately between one and one-half (1.5) to two (2) inches in length and the inner side section of air passageway <b>114</b> is approximately between one and three-quarter (1.75) to two (2) inches in length. The exterior side of air passageway <b>114</b> is approximately between one-half (&#xbd;) to three-quarter (&#xbe;) inch in thickness and each of the upper section and inner side section of air passageway <b>114</b> is approximately between one-half (&#xbd;) and three-eighth (&#x215c;) inch in thickness. The cavity formed by the four sides of air passageway <b>114</b> is approximately between three-quarter (&#xbe;) to seven-eighth (&#x215e;) inch in length and the orifice is approximately between one-eighth (&#x215b;) to one-quarter (&#xbc;) inch in width. </p>
<p id="P-0041" num="0041"> The aforementioned thickness of the sides of air passageway <b>114</b> have been found to provide sufficient stability when integrated toilet and air deodorizer <b>10</b> was made of ceramic or porcelain as is typical of conventional toilets. Moreover, the aforementioned width of the orifice was sufficient to not produce an audible suction noise when air is drawn through the orifice and into air passageway <b>114</b> and yet provide adequate drawing capability. Stated another way, an audible suction noise was detected when the width of the orifice was smaller than approximately one-eighth (&#x215b;) inch. It was also realized that the suction capability was significantly reduced when the width of the orifice was greater than one-quarter (&#xbc;) inch in width. </p>
<p id="P-0042" num="0042"> In another embodiment, a plurality of brace-like mechanisms may be placed in between the inner side of flush ring <b>108</b> and the inner side of air passageway <b>114</b> to provide support during the manufacturing (i.e., baking) of integrated toilet and air deodorizer <b>10</b>. The brace-like mechanisms function to brace the inner side of air passageway <b>114</b> and prevent the inner side of air passageway <b>114</b> from possibly collapsing toward the inner side of flush ring <b>108</b> and, thus, reducing the size of the orifice leading to air passageway <b>114</b>. </p>
<p id="P-0043" num="0043"> For example, four equidistantly positioned brace-like mechanisms may be placed in between the inner side of flush ring <b>108</b> and the inner side of air passageway <b>114</b> prior to the baking of integrated toilet and air deodorizer <b>10</b>. The brace-like mechanisms can then be removed upon successfully baking integrated toilet and air deodorizer <b>10</b>. The brace-like mechanisms can be of a material that enables it to remain in position during the baking process and be removed after the baking process. It is appreciated that the dimensions of the brace-like mechanism depend on factors such as, by way of example and not limitation, the size of the orifice, the actual number of brace-like mechanisms employed, and the positioning of the brace-like mechanisms. </p>
<p id="P-0044" num="0044"> In still another embodiment, the brace-like mechanisms can permanently form and become an integral part of integrated toilet and air deodorizer <b>10</b>. In this embodiment, the brace-like mechanisms can be of the same material as integrated toilet and air deodorizer <b>10</b>. </p>
<p id="P-0045" num="0045"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates a partial cross-sectional view of another embodiment of an arcuate air passageway <b>114</b> of integrated toilet and air deodorizer <b>10</b>, according to the present invention. In this embodiment, the upper surface of the lower section of air passageway <b>114</b> is sloped downward at an angle from the exterior side of air passageway <b>114</b> toward the orifice of air passageway <b>114</b>. A technical advantage provided by this sloping feature is that air passageway <b>114</b> and, in particular, the inside or cavity of air passageway <b>114</b> is easier to clean. For example, a user can use a cleaning utensil and readily reach and clean the inner surfaces of air passageway <b>114</b>. </p>
<p id="P-0046" num="0046"> Another technical advantage provided by this sloping feature is that the slope of the upper surface of the lower section of air passageway <b>114</b> prevents water and other substances which may enter air passageway <b>114</b> from remaining in air passageway <b>114</b>. Rather, in the event that water or other substances may enter air passageway <b>114</b>, these substances are likely to exit air passageway <b>114</b> through the orifice and into bowl <b>102</b>. </p>
<p id="P-0047" num="0047"> For example, similar to conventional toilets, integrated toilet and air deodorizer <b>10</b> may clog and overflow. In this instance, matter and other substances that are in bowl <b>102</b> may enter air passageway <b>114</b> through its orifice. The slope of the upper surface of the lower section of air passageway <b>114</b> facilitates the emptying of the water and other substances inside air passageway <b>114</b> into bowl <b>102</b> upon the removal of the clog. The slope prevents &#x201c;standing water&#x201d; and other undesirable substances from remaining or forming inside air passageway <b>114</b>. This greatly enhances the cleanliness and desirability of integrated toilet and air deodorizer <b>10</b>. </p>
<p id="P-0048" num="0048"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates a side elevation of another embodiment of integrated toilet and air deodorizer <b>10</b>, according to the present invention. In this embodiment, neck <b>116</b> comprises an inverted u-shaped section in between the rear of bowl <b>102</b> and water tank <b>106</b>. One end of the inverted u-shaped section of neck <b>116</b> is coupled to a curvilinear exhaust pipe <b>118</b>, which extends downwardly and forwardly from neck <b>116</b> to a hollow section of pedestal <b>104</b>. Inside the hollow section of pedestal <b>104</b>, exhaust pipe <b>118</b> extends downwardly to aperture <b>120</b>, thus, forming a passage from air passageway <b>114</b> to aperture <b>120</b> via neck <b>116</b>, including the inverted unshaped section, and exhaust pipe <b>118</b>. In this location, exhaust pipe <b>118</b> is suitable for coupling to a suitable air duct located, for example, underneath the floor upon which integrated toilet and air deodorizer <b>10</b> is situated. </p>
<p id="P-0049" num="0049"> A technical advantage is that the inverted u-shaped section of neck <b>116</b> functions as a dam-like device in blocking the water from entering exhaust pipe <b>118</b>. The height of the forward prong of the inverted u-shape section of neck <b>116</b> makes it more difficult for water from within bowl <b>102</b> from accidentally entering exhaust pipe <b>118</b> through air passageway <b>114</b> and neck <b>116</b>. For example, in an instance where integrated toilet and air deodorizer <b>10</b> overflows, the water is more likely to spill out over the rim of bowl <b>102</b> than enter exhaust pipe <b>118</b> through the inverted u-shaped section of neck <b>116</b>. </p>
<p id="P-0050" num="0050"> Another technical advantage is provided by the placement of aperture <b>120</b> inside the hollow section of pedestal <b>104</b>. Because at least a section of exhaust pipe <b>118</b> extends into the hollow section of pedestal <b>104</b>, integrated toilet and air deodorizer <b>10</b> is more aesthetically pleasing to a user. Moreover, the coupling between exhaust pipe <b>118</b> and an air duct (not shown) that directs the foul and unpleasant odors away from integrated toilet and air deodorizer <b>10</b> is within the hollow section of pedestal <b>104</b> and concealed from sight. Stated another way, no section of the air duct that connects to exhaust pipe <b>118</b> at aperture <b>120</b> protrudes out from an adjoining wall or floor near integrated toilet and air deodorizer <b>10</b>. This reduces the amount of clutter around integrated toilet and air deodorizer <b>10</b>. </p>
<p id="P-0051" num="0051"> It is appreciated that the inverted u-shape feature of neck <b>116</b> can readily be incorporated into the other various embodiments of integrated toilet and air deodorizer <b>10</b>, as well as the various modifications of these embodiments, as disclosed herein. </p>
<p id="P-0052" num="0052"> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> illustrates a side elevation of still another embodiment of integrated toilet and air deodorizer <b>10</b>, according to the present invention. In this embodiment, air passageway <b>114</b> extends to a neck <b>116</b>, which extends rearward and opens up into a chamber <b>126</b>. Water tank <b>106</b> is mounted to integrated toilet and air deodorizer <b>10</b> above chamber <b>126</b>, thus, chamber <b>126</b> is of sufficient strength and design (i.e., chamber <b>126</b> is designed to provide the necessary fastening devices needed to fasten water tank <b>106</b>) to support water tank <b>106</b>. Moreover, a water pipe that is suitable to deliver water from water tank <b>106</b> to flush ring <b>108</b> extends through chamber <b>126</b>. </p>
<p id="P-0053" num="0053"> Chamber <b>126</b> extends to a tail pipe <b>128</b>, which extends to aperture <b>120</b>. An air duct (not shown) can be coupled to tail pipe <b>128</b> at aperture <b>120</b> to direct the foul and unpleasant odors away from integrated toilet and air deodorizer <b>10</b>. Drain hole <b>122</b> is located at the bottom of chamber <b>126</b>. </p>
<p id="P-0054" num="0054"> This invention may be provided in other specific forms and embodiments without departing from the essential characteristics as described herein. The embodiments described above are to be considered in all aspects as illustrative only and not restrictive in any manner. The following claims rather than the foregoing description indicate the scope of the invention. </p>

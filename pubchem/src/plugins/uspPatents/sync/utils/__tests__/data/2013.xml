Benzinger et al., <i>Blast</i>-<i>Related Brain Injury: Imaging for Clinical and Research Applications: Report of the </i>2008 <i>St. Louis Workshop</i>, JOURNAL OF NEUROTRAUMA 26:2127, 2129 (December 2009) (Accessed Aug. 20, 2010, at www.liebertonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1089/neu.2009.0885) (citations omitted):

        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0008">&#x201c;It is important to have a basic understanding of the physics of blast insult prior to developing any hypothesis regarding bTBI mechanisms, countermeasures, or treatments. Understanding the processes by which a blast event ultimately inflicts stresses at the cellular and subcellular levels is also a prerequisite to the design of proper animal model testing and interpretation of results.</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0009">A blast event as considered here begins with a detonation, the nearly instantaneous combustion of a liquid or solid explosive material resulting in the generation of gaseous products at extremely high pressure and temperature (&#x2dc;150 k atm/&#x2dc;2 M psi, &#x2dc;3000&#xb0; K.). The gaseous detonation products expand rapidly into the surrounding atmosphere to about 3000-fold their original volume, and are visible as a luminous fireball. Primary fragmentation from the charge casing as well as dirt and ejecta from buried charges will be carried with the fireball expansion and are projected much further than the gaseous products. The rapid expansion of the fireball drives a shockwave into the surrounding air ahead of it. The combined violent expansion of product gases and propagated shockwave constitute the blast flow field.</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0010">The most distinctive feature of the air blast wave energy is the shock front, through which there is a nearly instantaneous change in all gas-dynamic conditions of the air (pressure, density, flow velocity, and temperature). While the air blast wave energy strength is often characterized exclusively in terms of the peak blast overpressure, it is important to note that this metric will usually refer to the static or side-on pressure above ambient levels, which does not represent the loading condition on a typical target. The static pressure is that pressure which would be sensed by a surface aligned parallel to the blastwave propagation, and hence does not experience the kinetic energy component of the flow, which may be many-fold higher than the static pressure component. If the same surface were perpendicular to the blast, it would obstruct the flow and be exposed to a much higher pressure of the reflected blast, including both the static and dynamic (kinetic energy) components. The actual stresses and waveform experienced at the cellular level will depend on the transfer function for the target, which is highly geometry- and material-dependent. These distinctions regarding the incident blast flow conditions, imparted loading, and cellular stresses have important implications with regard to the mechanisms for blast injury, as well as the proper simulation of blast in the laboratory, Whereas the static pressure profile is an important component of blast insult, it is by no means the only relevant energy component, particularly for victims within the area of the fireball, where kinetic energy of the flow is dominant.</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0011">The blast flow field exhibits energy in various modes in the hydrodynamic domain, including material flow (kinetic energy), static pressure, and internal energy (temperature). Due to the shock front, the frequency content of the incident wave is extremely high; indeed, the rate of the stress rise imparted to tissue followed by rapid relaxation may be of as much concern with regard to cellular damage as stress amplitude. Blast also can propagate energy in the electromagnetic domain, although the power spectrum is highly dependent on the device size and configuration.&#x201d;</li>

<p id="p-0009" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> includes a graph <b>10</b> illustrating pressure versus time of an example air blast wave energy <b>195</b>. The example blast wave represents an air blast wave energy produced by a blast event, such as a detonating high-order explosive. The graph represents time on a horizontal axis, and static or side-on pressure on a vertical axis expressed in units of overpressure P<sub>SO</sub>, or atmospheres above or below ambient pressure. The air blast wave includes a shock front <b>22</b>, which is typically traveling at a supersonic speed, is nearly vertical in its onset, and has a thickness generally estimated at less than one micron. The shock front is the leading edge of the air blast wave; it is the portion of the air blast wave transitioning from ambient atmospheric pressure to maximum overpressure. The air blast wave includes a region of overpressure <b>24</b>, and a region of underpressure <b>26</b>. Humans exposed to air blast waves generated by detonating high-order explosives are at risk for blast-related traumatic brain injury (bTBI), which is particularly relevant in current military engagements around the world, and which some consider the signature injury of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0013">Air blast waves, like light, ultrasonic, and sonic waves, are reflected at boundaries where there is a difference in acoustic impedances (Z) of the materials on each side of the boundary. This difference in Z is commonly referred to as the impedance mismatch. The greater the impedance mismatch, the greater the percentage of energy that will be reflected at the interface or boundary between one medium and another. Acoustic impedance (Z) values are generally expressed or used herein in MRayls unless otherwise indicated.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0014">The fraction of the incident wave intensity that is reflected can be derived because particle velocity and local particle pressures must be continuous across the boundary. When the acoustic impedances of the materials on both sides of the boundary are known, the fraction of the incident wave intensity that is reflected can be calculated with the equation below. The value produced is known as the reflection coefficient (R). Multiplying the reflection coefficient by 100% yields the calculated amount of energy reflected as a percentage of the original energy.</p>

<p id="p-0013" num="0015">Since the amount of reflected energy plus the transmitted energy must equal the total amount of incident energy, the transmission coefficient is calculated by simply subtracting the reflection coefficient from one.</p>

<p id="p-0073" num="0075">In the following detailed description, reference is made to the accompanying drawings, which form a part hereof. In the drawings, similar symbols typically identify similar components, unless context dictates otherwise. The illustrated embodiments described in the detailed description, drawings, and claims are not meant to be limiting. Other embodiments may be utilized, and other changes may be made, without departing from the spirit or scope of the subject matter presented here.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0076"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates an example environment <b>100</b> in which embodiments may be implemented. The environment includes a cross-sectional view of a human body <b>105</b> having an exterior body part portion <b>106</b>, which may for example include a head, leg, arm, trunk, or pelvis. The environment includes a blast event <b>193</b> creating an air blast wave <b>195</b> has an energy propagating across space from the blast event and illustrated as incident air blast wave energy <b>197</b>-I. For example, an air blast wave may include a shockwave originated by high explosive. For example, an air blast wave may include a range of overpressures occurring over a very short period of time. For example, an air blast wave may include an acoustic wave moving at or close to the speed of sound. For example, an incident air blast wave energy may include a wave traveling from its blast source and toward a receiving human body, such as the incident air blast wave energy <b>197</b>-I traveling from the blast event <b>193</b> toward the human body <b>105</b>. While the air blast wave energy <b>197</b>-I is schematically illustrated by a single line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, in a typical combat situation the air blast wave energy will envelop most or all of the exterior body part portion of the human body, for example, such as a helmet or chest pad.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0077">The environment illustrated includes a cross-sectional view of an air blast wave energy protection device <b>101</b>. In an embodiment, the air blast wave energy protection device is wearable in a combat situation. The environment illustrated includes an air gap <b>198</b> between the exterior body part portion <b>106</b> and the device <b>101</b>. In an embodiment, the air gap may be approximately zero.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0078">The air blast wave energy protection device <b>101</b> includes a layer of a first material <b>110</b> having a thickness <b>116</b> and a layer of a second material <b>120</b> having a thickness <b>126</b>. The layer of a first material is shaped and configured to reflect a substantial portion of a specified incident air blast wave energy <b>197</b>-I. For example, &#x201c;configured&#x201d; may include designed, arranged, set up, shaped, optimized, tuned, adapted, capable of, or with a view to. For example, the specified incident air blast wave energy may be described at least in part by an overpressure, or a range of overpressures. For example, the specified incident air blast wave energy may be described at least in part by a velocity. For example, the specified incident air blast wave energy may be described at least in part by a shock front.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0079">The layer of the first material <b>110</b> has (i) an acoustic impedance substantially mismatched to the acoustic impedance of air. The acoustic impedance of air is approximately 0.0004. In an embodiment for example, carbon fiber has a range of acoustic impedances between approximately 3.3 to 40 depending on specific structure, which in this embodiment is considered substantially mismatched to the acoustic impedance of air. In an embodiment for example, aluminum has an acoustic impedance of 17, which in this embodiment is considered substantially mismatched to the acoustic impedance of air. In an embodiment for example, zinc has an acoustic impedance of 29.6, which in this embodiment is considered substantially mismatched to the acoustic impedance of air. In an embodiment for example, steel has an acoustic impedance of 46, which in this embodiment is considered substantially mismatched to the acoustic impedance of air.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0080">The layer thickness of the first material <b>110</b> is less than about 3 mm. In an embodiment, a layer of first material having a thickness of at least approximately the mean free path of air (0.066 microns, sometimes approximated as 1 micron) would be theoretically expected to reflect a substantial portion of the specified incident air blast wave energy <b>197</b>-I. However, because the blast wave may not have point source characteristics due to irregularities in the explosive or a positioning of the explosive, or due to irregularities in the path of the air blast wave energy such as buildings or armored vehicles, in an alternative embodiment, a layer of the first material that is approximately one order of magnitude thicker (approximately 10-15 times) than the mean free path of air is expected to reflect a substantial portion of the specified incident air blast wave energy. In an embodiment, the layer of the first material may include a rigid layer of the first material. For example, a rigid layer of the first material may not be deflected by the specified air blast wave energy. For example, the rigid layer of the first material may include a rigid layer of the first material that does not substantially bend, deform, or change shape in response to the specified air blast wave energy. In an embodiment, the rigid layer of the first material may be deflected by the specified air blast wave energy. For example, the layer of the first material may include a flexible layer of the first material that substantially bends, deforms, or changes shape in response to the specified air blast wave energy. In an embodiment, the layer of the first material may include a non-rigid layer. For example, the non-rigid layer of the first material may be deflectable by the specified air blast wave energy. In an embodiment, the layer of the first material may be at least substantially destroyed by the energy of the specified air blast wave energy.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0081">The layer of a second material <b>120</b> is shaped and configured to attenuate a substantial portion of the specified incident air blast wave energy <b>197</b>-I transmitted through the layer of the first material <b>110</b>. The attenuation utilizes an inelastic response to attenuate the specified incident air blast wave energy. For example, an inelastic response may include a crumpling response, a crushing response, or a plastic flow response. The portion of specified incident air blast wave energy <b>197</b>-I transmitted through the layer of the first material <b>110</b> and that falls on the front surface <b>122</b> of the layer of the second material is illustrated as air blast wave energy <b>197</b>-T.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0082">For example, the air blast wave energy <b>197</b>-T is the portion of the specified incident air blast wave energy <b>197</b>-I that passes through the layer of the first material and is transmitted from the back surface <b>114</b> of the layer of the first material. The portion of the air blast wave energy <b>197</b>-T that is transmitted through the layer of the second material <b>120</b> and toward the exterior body part portion <b>106</b> is illustrated as air blast wave energy <b>197</b>-H. For example, the air blast wave energy <b>197</b>-H is the portion of the air blast wave energy <b>197</b>-T that passes through the layer of the second material and is transmitted from the back surface <b>124</b> of the layer of the second material. The layer of the second material is shaped and configured for wearing proximate to the exterior portion <b>106</b> of the human body <b>105</b>. In an embodiment, the specified incident air blast wave energy transmitted <b>197</b>-T from the layer of the first material includes that portion of the specified incident air blast wave energy <b>197</b>-I transmitted across an interface formed by the proximate <b>180</b> a back surface <b>114</b> of the layer of the first material <b>110</b> and a front surface <b>122</b> of the layer of the second material <b>120</b>. In an embodiment, a layer of an intermediate material (not illustrated) may be interposed between the back surface of the layer of the first material and the front surface of the layer of the second material. In such an embodiment, the specified incident air blast wave energy transmitted through the layer of the first material would include the specified incident air blast wave energy transmitted through the layer of the first material and the interposed layer.</p>

<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A headpiece assembly for use with a night vision mounting arm includes a bump shell and an interior suspension assembly for seating on the head of a human. A mounting bracket is secured to the front of the bump shell for removably attaching the night vision mounting arm to the bump shell. A ballistic shell has a bottom forming an opening and a coupling mechanism for removably securing the ballistic shell to the bump shell when the ballistic shell is placed over the bump shell. The ballistic shell has a front and a notch extending upwardly from the opening into the front for receiving the mounting bracket when the ballistic shell is placed over the bump shell so as to permit the night vision mounting arm to be attached to the bump shell during use of the ballistic shell.</p>

The M1 helmet included a &#x201c;steel pot&#x201d; portion made of metal and a liner that nestled inside the steel pot. The M1 helmet was a &#x201c;one-size-fits-all&#x201d; type helmet, where the size was fitted by adjusting the liner. In the early 1980's, advances in material caused the M1 helmet to give way to the Personal Armor System for Ground Troops (PASGT), which included a Kevlar helmet and vest. The PASGT helmet was produced in five sizes and, while offering more protection than the M1 helmet, still weighed about the same. More recently, the PASGT helmet has given way to the Modular Integrated Communications Helmet (MICH), the Advanced Combat Helmet (ACH), and the Lightweight Helmet (LWH). The MICH is primarily used by Special Operations, the ACH is primarily used by the Army, and the LWH is primarily used by the Marines and the Navy. These later helmets, while an improvement over the steel pot type helmets of the World War II era, are still in need of improvements relating to weight and versatility.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The present application relates to a headpiece assembly <b>100</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>, having a removable ballistic shell <b>102</b> and a bump shell <b>104</b> with a suspension assembly <b>106</b>. The bump shell <b>104</b> together with the suspension assembly <b>106</b> may be worn alone or with the ballistic shell <b>102</b> in place atop the bump shell <b>104</b>. When worn alone, the bump shell <b>104</b> may protect the human head in a hardhat-like fashion against contact with overlying material or equipment or falling or flying debris. The bump shell <b>104</b> may also be adapted for attachment of devices, tools, or other equipment, such as, for example, a night vision arm <b>105</b> or ancillary equipment adapters <b>107</b>. The ballistic shell <b>102</b> may be worn to provide additional protection such as protection against bullets, shrapnel, or other impalements resulting from combat and as such, the headpiece assembly <b>100</b> may also be referred to as a ballistic headpiece <b>100</b>. The ballistic shell <b>102</b> may fit over the bump shell <b>104</b> and may include a coupling mechanism <b>108</b> for attaching the ballistic shell <b>102</b> to the bump shell <b>104</b>. The ballistic shell <b>102</b> may also be configured to accommodate one or more of the devices on the bump shell <b>104</b> to facilitate ease of placing and removing the ballistic shell <b>102</b> while also facilitating use of the devices while the ballistic shell <b>102</b> is in place. The headpiece assembly <b>100</b> may also include a rear attachment device <b>110</b> for connection to the bump shell <b>104</b> or the ballistic shell <b>102</b> and adapted for securing equipment to its surface.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The following detailed description describes each of the portions of the headpiece assembly <b>100</b>, in detail, beginning with the suspension assembly <b>106</b>, moving to the bump shell <b>104</b> and the ballistic shell <b>102</b>, and ending with a discussion of the rear attachment device <b>110</b>. While reference to the figures will be made to provide examples of what is being described, the detailed description is not limited to the embodiment shown in the figures.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The suspension assembly <b>106</b> may be described with general reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-11</figref>. The suspension assembly <b>106</b> may be adapted to support the headpiece <b>100</b> on a human head (not shown) by nesting within the bump shell <b>104</b>. As such, the suspension assembly <b>106</b> may also be referred to as the interior suspension assembly <b>106</b> as it may be positioned or disposed at least partially within the bump shell <b>104</b>. The suspension assembly <b>106</b> may include a unitary impact protection element <b>112</b> and a mounting assembly <b>114</b>. The unitary impact protection element <b>112</b>, or impact protection element <b>112</b>, may be configured to suitably rest on a human head and hold the bump shell <b>104</b> in a spaced-apart relationship relative to the human head. The mounting assembly <b>114</b> may be configured to secure the impact protection element <b>112</b> to a human head and allow for adjustment to suitably fit a human head.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">With regard to the impact protection element <b>112</b>, also referred to as the liner, foam liner, or spacer, several of the following elements may be included and will be described in detail. The element <b>112</b> may include a generally concave inner or head side <b>116</b>, a generally convex outer or shell side <b>118</b>, and a bottom forming an opening. The head side <b>116</b> may be adapted for seating on the human head and the shell side <b>118</b> may be adapted for nesting within the bump shell <b>104</b>. Additional elements may include vents <b>120</b> extending from the head side <b>116</b> to the shell side <b>118</b> and slots <b>122</b> and recessed areas <b>124</b> adapted for accommodating the mounting assembly <b>114</b>. Further elements of the impact protection element may include depressions <b>126</b>, <b>127</b> for accommodating fastening mechanisms to connect the impact protection element <b>112</b> to the bump shell <b>104</b> or to accommodate padding. Additionally, cavities <b>129</b> may be provided to accommodate a portion of the coupling mechanism <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Each of these elements will now each be described in detail. It is noted that several of the elements may be defined by their relation to the human head. By way of background, the human head includes several regions defined by the several bones that make up the human skull. One of these regions is a frontal region corresponding to the frontal bone of the skull in the forehead portion of the head. Another region is the parietal region corresponding to the parietal bone of the skull in the top and back portion of the head. Another region is the occipital region corresponding to the occipital bone of the skull in the lower back of the head. On opposing sides of the head, temporal regions are defined by a temporal bone of the skull.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The impact protection element <b>112</b>, or liner, may include areas corresponding to these several anatomic regions of the human head. For example, the impact protection element <b>112</b> may include a frontal area <b>128</b> corresponding to the frontal region of a wearer's head and a parietal area <b>130</b> corresponding to the parietal region of a wearer's head. In addition, the impact protection element <b>112</b> may include portions dividing up the several areas. For example, the impact protection element <b>112</b> may include a front portion <b>135</b> making up the frontal area <b>128</b> and a top portion <b>137</b> and rear portion <b>139</b> making up the parietal area <b>130</b>. Additional regions and portions within each region can be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">With particular regard to the head side <b>116</b> of the impact protection element <b>112</b>, reference is made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. The head side may be adapted to substantially cover the frontal region and parietal region of the human head. The head side <b>116</b> may have a contour in the front portion <b>135</b> reflecting that of the frontal region of the human head and a contour in the top portion <b>137</b> and rear portion <b>139</b> reflecting that of the parietal region of the human head. Accordingly, the transition <b>131</b> between the front portion <b>135</b> and the top portion <b>137</b> may be positioned at or near the corresponding transition in the frontal and parietal regions of the skull. The transition <b>133</b> between the top portion <b>137</b> and the rear portion <b>139</b> may be positioned along a line extending from the mid-squamous region on one side of the head to the mid-squamous region on the opposing side of the head. The head side <b>116</b> may include a front edge <b>132</b> configured to encroach the eyebrow area of the head and a rear edge <b>140</b> following the contour of the back of the head and configured for positioning at or just below the occipital protuberance. As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the head side <b>116</b> may include substantially curvilinear side edges <b>136</b> extending from the front edge <b>132</b> around the side of the head. As the side edge <b>136</b> extends away from the front edge <b>132</b>, a smooth upward curve may be provided in the temple region of the head causing the side edge <b>136</b> to extend a short distance upward before an additional smooth curve causes the side edge <b>136</b> to extend toward the rear again. The side edge <b>136</b> may further extend toward the rear of the head following a path similar to that of the seam between the parietal bone and the temporal bone and, as such, curve downward along the rear edge of the temporal bone. The side edge <b>136</b> may extend along the side of the head to the rear edge <b>140</b> of the head side <b>116</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The head side <b>116</b> may be a generally continuous surface defined by the front portion <b>135</b> in the frontal area <b>128</b> and the top portion <b>137</b> and rear portion <b>139</b> in the parietal area <b>130</b>. However, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the head side <b>116</b> may be interrupted by openings to form vents <b>120</b> extending through the impact protection element <b>112</b>. The perimeter edge of the openings may include a radiused edge falling away from the surface of the head side <b>116</b> and intersecting with walls defining the vent <b>120</b> extending through the impact protection element <b>112</b>. One or more vents <b>120</b> may be provided. As shown, in one embodiment, four vents <b>120</b> may be provided and positioned in a radial array where the vents <b>120</b> are substantially equally spaced about the crown of the impact protection element <b>112</b>. As also shown, the array may be oriented such that one vent <b>120</b> is positioned in each of four quadrants defined by a longitudinal axis extending in a forward and rear direction and a transverse axis extending in a side to side direction. In other embodiments, other orientations can be provided. For example, a five vent arrangement may be provided similar to the four vent arrangement, but with an additional vent <b>120</b> positioned on a longitudinal axis of the assembly between the vents <b>120</b> in the rear portion <b>139</b> of the impact protection element <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The head side <b>116</b> may also include depressions <b>126</b> defining padding locations where comfort and/or absorbent pads may be adhered or otherwise secured to the impact protection element <b>112</b>. Other surface indentations and recesses may be provided. As shown best in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, one or more depressions <b>126</b> may be provided around the inner surface of the impact protection element <b>112</b>. In one embodiment, four depressions may be provided where two are positioned in the frontal portion <b>135</b> of the head side <b>116</b> and two are positioned along the lateral sides of the top portion <b>137</b> of the impact protection element <b>112</b>. Accordingly, when the mounting assembly <b>114</b> is tightened, the pads positioned in the depressions <b>126</b> may be drawn against the front and sides of the wearer's head. Other depression positions may also be provided including positions in the rear portion <b>139</b> of the impact protection element <b>112</b>. The depressions <b>126</b> may be relatively broad square, rectangular, trapezoidal or other shapes so as to accommodate relatively broad pads to suitably distribute loads and suitably absorb perspiration, while also allowing air flow between the impact protection element <b>112</b> and the wearer's head.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The shell side <b>118</b> of the impact protection element <b>112</b> may be generally convex and may share the front, rear, and side edges <b>132</b>, <b>140</b>, <b>136</b> with the head side <b>116</b> described. The surface of the shell side <b>118</b> of the impact protection element <b>112</b> may have a similar contour to the head side <b>116</b> or another contour can be provided. As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the longitudinal contour of the shell side <b>118</b> may be a substantially continuous contour extending from the front edge <b>132</b> to the rear edge <b>140</b> of the impact protection element <b>112</b> where the curvature of the shell side <b>118</b> in the front portion <b>135</b> is relatively sharp, the curvature through the top portion <b>137</b> is relatively mild and the curvature through the rear portion <b>139</b> is relatively sharp again. As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the transverse contour of the shell side <b>118</b> from one side edge <b>136</b> to the opposing side edge <b>136</b> may have a relatively sharp curvature as the surface extends from one side edge <b>136</b> up to the top of the parietal area <b>130</b> where the curvature may be relatively mild and, again, a relatively sharp curvature as the surface extends to the opposing side edge <b>136</b>. As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the surface contour of the shell side <b>118</b> of the impact protection element <b>112</b> may be configured for nesting within the bump shell <b>104</b> and, accordingly, may take on any surface contour similar to the bump shell <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The shell side <b>118</b> of the impact protection element <b>112</b> may be a generally continuous surface. However, like the head side <b>116</b>, the shell side <b>118</b> may be interrupted by openings to form vents <b>120</b> extending through the impact protection element <b>112</b>. The perimeter edge of the openings may include a radiused edge falling away from the surface of the shell side <b>118</b> and intersecting with walls defining the vent <b>120</b> extending through the impact protection element <b>112</b>. The shelf side <b>118</b> may also include depressions <b>127</b> defining securing locations where hook and loop securing elements (e.g., Velcro) can be placed, allowing the impact protection element <b>112</b> to be secured to the bump shell <b>104</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the shell side <b>118</b> surface may also include ballistic shell clip cavities <b>129</b> along rear edge <b>140</b>. The cavities <b>129</b> may be generally rectangular in shape and may be positioned generally symmetrically about a centerline of the impact protection element <b>112</b> and in a position corresponding to the clips <b>146</b> on an inner surface of the ballistic shell <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In addition, and as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5</figref>, <b>10</b>, and <b>11</b>, the shell side <b>118</b> of the impact protection element <b>112</b> may also include recessed areas <b>124</b> to accommodate straps <b>150</b> of the mounting assembly <b>114</b> described below. The areas <b>124</b> may extend across the shell side <b>118</b> surface of the impact protection element <b>112</b> and may have a width and depth the same as or slightly larger than the strap <b>150</b> allowing the strap <b>150</b> to lie in the channel without projecting above the shell side surface. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the shell side surface may include a slot <b>122</b> positioned at or near the end of a recessed area <b>124</b> that extends longitudinally along the shell side surface. The slot <b>122</b> may have a width and thickness slightly larger than a corresponding strap <b>150</b> allowing the strap <b>150</b> to be positioned through the impact protection element <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The impact protection element <b>112</b> can be made from an impact attenuating material. In one embodiment, the material is a foam material. More particularly, the foam may be an expanded polypropylene. Other foams, pads, insulations, or other attenuating material may be used. In one embodiment, the impact protection element <b>112</b> may be made from a single material. In other embodiments, the impact protection element <b>112</b> may include several materials in several layers or located in several locations.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In one embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref>, the impact protection element <b>112</b> may be made from a material with different densities. As such, the impact protection element <b>112</b> may include one or more density regions. As shown, the impact protection element may include a first density region <b>143</b>, a second density region <b>145</b>, and a third density region <b>147</b>. As shown, the density regions may correspond to the front, top, and rear portions <b>135</b>, <b>137</b>, <b>139</b> of the impact protection element <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Other arrangements of the density regions may be provided and the several densities may or may not correspond to the several portions of the impact protection element <b>112</b>. However, in some embodiments, the several densities may be particularly adapted to protect particular areas of the head and as such, the transitions between them may correspond to the seams between the regions of a wearer's head. That is, in the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref>, the density in the second density region <b>145</b> may be higher than that of the first and third density regions <b>143</b>, <b>147</b> in an effort to more thoroughly protect the top portion of the parietal region of the head, while also minimizing the weight by providing lesser densities in the first and third density regions <b>143</b>, <b>147</b>. The density of the material can be selected based on the type of material being used together with the level of protection desired. For example, the material may be an expanded polypropylene foam and the density of the density regions may range from approximately 1 pound per cubic foot to 5 pounds per cubic foot. In one embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref>, the first and third density regions <b>143</b>, <b>147</b> may have a density ranging from approximately 2.0 pounds per cubic foot to approximately 2.4 pounds per cubic foot. In this embodiment, the density of the second density region <b>145</b> may range from approximately 3.0 pounds per cubic foot to approximately 3.2 pounds per cubic foot. Other combinations of densities in the density regions can be used, such as the first and second density region having a higher density and the third density region having a lower density. Additionally, other combinations may include each density region having a different density or all three density regions having the same density. In still other embodiments, alternative numbers of density regions may be provided such as, for example, two density regions or more than three density regions.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The thickness of the impact protection element <b>112</b> can also be adjusted to provide suitable protection to the wearer's head. In some embodiments, the impact protection element may have a thickness between the outer and inner sides <b>118</b>, <b>116</b> ranging from approximately &#xbc; inch to approximately 3 inches. In another embodiment, the thickness may range from approximately &#xbc; inch to approximately 2 inches. In still another embodiment, the thickness may be approximately &#xbc; inch.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In one embodiment, the several materials can be adhered to one another to form the impact protection element <b>112</b> or the materials can be fused to form a monolithic element. It may be advantageous for purposes of better protection to construct the impact protection element <b>112</b> free of seams and joints. Accordingly, in one embodiment, the impact protection element <b>112</b> may be constructed by injecting beads into a mold from multiple ports, where the ports are positioned to place beads injected therethrough in a particular density region of the protection element <b>112</b>. For example, a port may be positioned in the second density region <b>145</b> and beads with a higher density may be injected through the port. In the first and third density regions <b>143</b>, <b>147</b>, additional ports may be provided through which lower density beads may be injected. Upon placement of the beads, the mold may be heated, steamed, or otherwise treated to fuse the beads in the several density regions of the impact protection element <b>112</b> together. In other embodiments, the several regions may be co-injected. Other processes can be provided to create a unitary impact protection element <b>112</b> between one or more of the materials used.</p>

For example, a rail such as that currently sold by OPS CORE may be secured to the ballistic shell <b>102</b> via the perforations <b>232</b> shown. As such, the perforations <b>232</b> may be positioned to align with the fastening elements on the rail or another rail provided by a different manufacturer.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The second portion of the coupling mechanism <b>108</b> of the ballistic shell <b>102</b> may be configured to couple the ballistic shell <b>102</b> to the bump shell <b>104</b> by engaging the first portion of the coupling mechanism <b>108</b> positioned on the bump shell <b>104</b>. Accordingly, the second portion of the coupling mechanism <b>108</b> of the ballistic shell <b>102</b> may include clips <b>146</b> for engaging the slots <b>198</b> near the rear edge <b>228</b> of the bump shell <b>104</b> and ratchet surfaces <b>236</b> positioned to engage the corresponding ratchet surfaces <b>200</b> on the bump shell <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21 and 23</figref>, the clips <b>146</b> may include flexible tabs <b>238</b> positioned along the rear edge <b>228</b> of the ballistic shell <b>102</b>. The tabs <b>238</b> may be adhered or otherwise fastened to the inside surface of the ballistic shell <b>102</b> and may extend downward toward and/or beyond the rear edge <b>228</b> of the ballistic shell <b>102</b>. The tabs <b>238</b> may be fastened to the inside surface of the ballistic shell <b>102</b> with fasteners extending through the perforations <b>232</b> previously described and, as such, a single fastener can be used to retain the tabs <b>238</b> as well as an ancillary equipment rail, for example. The rear edge <b>228</b> of the ballistic shell may be flared outward causing the inside surface of the ballistic shell to diverge from the outside surface of the tab <b>238</b> and creating a gap therebetween. An engagement feature <b>240</b> may be positioned on the flexible tab <b>238</b> at a position corresponding to the position of the slots <b>198</b> on the bump shell <b>104</b>. The engagement feature <b>240</b> may include an additional tab or ledge directed inwardly from the flexible tab <b>238</b>. The engagement feature <b>240</b> may also be a hook or other feature for engaging the slot <b>198</b> on the rear side of the bump shell <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The ratchet surfaces <b>236</b> on the ballistic shell <b>102</b> may be the same or similar to those on the bump shell <b>104</b>, but may be oriented with a ratchet direction extending away from the front edge <b>224</b>. As such, the ratchet surfaces <b>236</b> may be in the form of ratchet strips positioned on the inside surface of the ballistic shell <b>102</b> in a position corresponding to the ratchet surfaces <b>200</b> on the bump shell <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The rear attachment device <b>110</b> can be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24-28</figref>. The rear attachment device <b>110</b> may be configured for attachment to the back of the bump shell <b>104</b> or the ballistic shell <b>102</b>. The rear attachment device <b>110</b> may include a securing surface <b>242</b> for attachment of equipment. The rear attachment device <b>110</b> may also include a securing mechanism <b>244</b> connected to the securing surface <b>242</b> for securing the device <b>110</b> to a shell <b>102</b>, <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The securing surface <b>242</b> of the rear attachment device <b>110</b> may be a substantially flat surface adapted for adjacent placement of equipment such as a battery pack, radio, or other equipment mountable to a flat surface. The securing surface <b>242</b> may have a size slightly smaller than an area defined by the rear projection of the bump shell <b>104</b>. The securing surface <b>242</b> may be generally rectangular in shape and one or more slots <b>246</b> may pass through the surface <b>242</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>, four slots are shown, two positioned adjacent each end of the securing surface <b>242</b>. The slots <b>246</b> may extend through the securing surface <b>242</b> and a strap cavity <b>246</b> may be provided behind each slot <b>246</b> to accommodate straps being passed through the slots <b>246</b> and around the end of the securing surface <b>242</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The securing mechanism <b>244</b> of the rear attachment device may include one or more hooks <b>250</b> for engaging a bottom edge of the shell and a concave surface <b>252</b> substantially conforming to the outer surface of the bump shell <b>104</b> and the ballistic shell <b>102</b>. The one or more hooks <b>250</b> may extend downward from the securing surface <b>242</b> and have a hook configured to engage the rear edge of the shell. As shown, two hooks <b>250</b> may be provided and the hooks <b>250</b> may be spaced apart from one another and have a width suitable for engaging the rear edge of the shell. The hooks <b>250</b> may be arranged to follow the curvature of the rear edge of the shell and as such may be oriented at an angle relative to the securing surface <b>242</b> as best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>. The concave surface <b>252</b> may be positioned opposite to the securing surface <b>242</b> as best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>. The concave surface <b>252</b> may have a contoured surface similar to the rear parietal area of the bump shell <b>104</b> and the ballistic shell <b>102</b>. The concave surface <b>252</b> may be positioned substantially flush with the top edge of the securing surface <b>242</b> and extend downwardly for a portion of the height of the securing surface <b>242</b>. The concave surface <b>252</b> may include an adhering feature such as hook and loop, adhesive, or other feature configured to removably secure the concave surface <b>252</b> to the convex surface of the shell.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">In operation and use, a wearer can use the headpiece assembly <b>100</b> in at least two general ways at different times. That is, the wearer can wear the bump shell <b>104</b> alone or the wearer can wear the bump shell <b>104</b> together with the ballistic shell <b>102</b>. This flexibility of allowing the bump shell <b>104</b> to be worn alone provides the advantage of offering protection against relatively minor injuries such as bumps, bruises, or even concussions, without the need to wear the heavier ballistic protection <b>102</b>, which may be more suitable for preventing more serious or even deadly injuries to the head.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">When wearing the bump shell <b>104</b> alone, the bump shell <b>104</b> may be placed upon the wearers head and chin straps extending from the securing elements <b>182</b> on the bump shell <b>104</b> may be fastened around a wearer's chin. The bump shell <b>104</b> may be worn, for example, by a soldier during exercises, drills, or other activities when otherwise not in combat or even simulated combat. The suspension assembly <b>106</b> of the bump shell <b>104</b> may be attached to the interior surface of the bump shell <b>104</b> by a hook and loop, or other adhering system. As such, the suspension assembly <b>106</b> may be removed from the bump shell for maintenance or replacement.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">As shown best in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18 and 19</figref>, the bump shell <b>104</b> can be used with a night vision system and other ancillary equipment. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, a night vision arm <b>105</b> can be attached to the mounting bracket <b>176</b> positioned on the front of the bump shell <b>104</b>. The night vision mounting arm <b>105</b> may be positioned on the mounting bracket by actuating the lever <b>188</b> and sliding the mounting plate under the retaining elements <b>186</b> of the mounting bracket <b>176</b>. Once the mounting plate clears the lever <b>188</b>, the lever <b>188</b> can be released thereby securing the mounting arm <b>105</b> to the mounting bracket <b>176</b>. The wearer can then rely on the night vision as desired by rotating the night vision arm <b>105</b> down in front of the wearer's face to allow sight through night vision goggles.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">In addition, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, ancillary equipment adapters <b>107</b> can be attached to the recessed channels <b>210</b> on the sides of the bump shell <b>104</b>. These adapters <b>107</b>, such as, for example, ACH-ARC Adapters provided by OPS CORE, may be slid into the front or rear of the channels <b>210</b> and secured with the OPS CORE catches (not shown), which may engage the perforations or recesses <b>216</b>, <b>218</b>. For example, a Picatinny adapter, which may engage the perforations <b>216</b>, or a Wing-loc adapter, which may engage the perforations <b>218</b>, may be used. In other embodiments, other adapters <b>107</b> can be slid into the channels <b>210</b> and secured with set screws, spring pins, or any other restraining type mechanism. The adapters <b>107</b> can then be used to secure flash lights, strobes, or other equipment to the headpiece <b>100</b> for use by the wearer.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Adding still further versatility, the rear attachment device <b>110</b> may be attached to the bump shell <b>104</b> by hooking the hooks <b>250</b> of the device <b>110</b> under the rear edge <b>174</b> of the bump shell <b>104</b> and pressing the concave surface <b>252</b> of the device <b>110</b> against the back of the bump shell <b>104</b>. Hook and loop materials, such as Velcro, can be used to secure the concave surface <b>252</b> to the bump shell <b>104</b>. Once in place, batteries, radios, or other equipment requiring a flat surface for attachment may be secured to the securing surface <b>252</b> of the rear attachment device <b>110</b>. The rear attachment device <b>110</b> may be magnetized to secure equipment or hook and loop material or even tape can be provided on the securing surface <b>242</b>. In addition, or alternatively, straps and/or tape can be inserted through the slots <b>246</b> on each end of the securing surface <b>242</b> and equipment can be strapped to the securing surface <b>242</b> of the rear attachment device <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">When the wearer desires or requires more protection than that provided by the bump shell <b>104</b>, the wearer may place the ballistic shell <b>102</b> over the bump shell <b>104</b>. If ancillary equipment adapters <b>107</b> are in place on the bump shell <b>104</b> or the rear attachment device <b>110</b> is in place on the bump shell <b>104</b>, these items may be removed to provide a clean surface over which to place the ballistic shell <b>102</b>. It is noted that the night vision arm <b>105</b> may remain attached to the bump shell <b>104</b> for placement of the ballistic shell <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">To place the ballistic shell <b>102</b>, the wearer may place the engagement features <b>240</b> of the clips <b>146</b> on the ballistic shell <b>102</b> into the slots <b>198</b> near the rear edge of the bump shell <b>104</b>. The wearer may then rotate the ballistic shell <b>102</b> forward over the bump shell <b>104</b> causing the ratchet surfaces <b>236</b> on the inside surface of the ballistic shell <b>102</b> to engage the ratchet surfaces <b>200</b> on the front portion of the bump shell <b>104</b>. The wearer can pull down on the ballistic shell <b>102</b> to secure the ballistic shell <b>102</b> by passing the ratchet surfaces <b>200</b>, <b>236</b> along one another to engage the ratchet teeth <b>202</b>. It is noted that the tapered shape of the side edges of the notch <b>230</b> in the ballistic shell <b>102</b> allow for the notch to pass down around the mounting bracket <b>176</b> without undue friction. That is, were the side edges oriented in a more vertical fashion, the edges may need to slide along the mounting bracket <b>176</b> and the reinforcing element for proper positioning and the sliding motion may cause the sides of the notch <b>230</b> to catch as the notch passes down around the mounting bracket <b>176</b>. When the ballistic shell <b>102</b> is placed upon the bump shell <b>104</b>, it is further noted that the lip <b>238</b> along the periphery <b>236</b> of the notch <b>230</b> of the ballistic shell <b>102</b> may overlap with the ledge <b>196</b> on the reinforcing element <b>190</b> of the bump shell <b>104</b>. As such, impalements directed toward the seam between the mounting bracket <b>176</b> for the night vision arm <b>105</b> and the edge of the ballistic shell <b>102</b> may be arrested by the first tier <b>192</b> of the reinforcing element <b>190</b> passing behind this seam.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Upon placing the ballistic shell <b>102</b>, the wearer may replace the rear attachment device <b>110</b> upon the headpiece assembly <b>100</b> by engaging the hooks <b>250</b> of the device <b>110</b> along the rear edge of the assembly <b>100</b> and pressing the concave surface <b>252</b> of the device <b>110</b> against the rear parietal region of the surface of the ballistic shell <b>102</b>. As with the attachment to the bump shell <b>104</b>, hook and loop or other systems can be used to adhere or attach the concave surface <b>252</b> to the surface of the ballistic shell <b>102</b>. In addition, ancillary equipment rails such as, for example, OPS CORE ACH-ARC rails, may be attached to the ballistic shell <b>102</b> by bolting the rails to the perforations <b>232</b> positioned on the ballistic shell <b>102</b>. Where the clips <b>146</b> on the ballistic shell are bolted in place, as opposed to adhered or otherwise secured to the inner surface of the ballistic shell <b>102</b>, a single bolt can be used to secure the rear portion of the rail and the clips <b>146</b>. Ancillary equipment adapters <b>107</b> such as, for example, ACH-ARC adapters as described with respect to the bump shell <b>104</b> may be positioned on and attached to the rails. Ancillary equipment may then be supported on or mounted to the adapters <b>107</b> or directly to the rails. As for the night vision arm <b>105</b>, the notch <b>230</b> in the ballistic shell <b>102</b> allows the placement of the ballistic shell <b>102</b> without affecting the position or use of the night vision arm <b>105</b> and it thus, may be used in the same fashion as when the bump shell <b>104</b> is worn alone.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">When a wearer desires to remove the ballistic shell <b>102</b>, the wearer may reach upward underneath the assembly and grasp the clips <b>146</b> extending downward from the rear edge <b>228</b> of the ballistic shell <b>102</b>. The divergence of the flared rear edge <b>228</b> of the ballistic shell <b>102</b> from the outside surface of the clips <b>146</b> may allow the user to squeeze the clips <b>146</b> toward the inner surface of the ballistic shell <b>102</b> thereby releasing the engagement features <b>240</b> on the clips <b>146</b> from the slots <b>198</b> in the bump shell <b>104</b>. Upon releasing the engagement features <b>240</b>, the rear portion of the ballistic shell <b>102</b> may be lifted causing the ballistic shell <b>102</b> to rotate forward on the wearer's head and release the ratchet surfaces <b>236</b> near the front of the assembly <b>100</b>. The wearer may then replace any ancillary equipment adapters <b>107</b> and/or rear attachment devices <b>110</b> on the bump shell <b>104</b> as desired.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">While the headpiece assembly has been described in detail above, several alternatives will be apparent to those of skill in the art and these alternatives are within the scope of the invention. For example, the securing surface <b>252</b> on the rear attachment device <b>110</b> may be round, triangular, or other shapes. It may also have a concave, convex, or other contour adapted to engage particular types of equipment. Still further, the slots <b>246</b> in the securing surface <b>252</b> of the rear attachment device <b>110</b> could be loops, clips, or other devices for securing straps.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">In still other embodiments, the bump shell <b>104</b> and the ballistic shell <b>102</b> may be configured for use with varying sizes of one or the other. That is, the bump shell <b>104</b> may be provided in a variety of sizes and the ballistic shell <b>102</b> may be provided in a single size where the ratchet connection of the ballistic shell <b>102</b> to the bump shell <b>104</b> allows for a tight fit of several sizes. In other embodiments, the bump shell <b>104</b> may be a one-size-fits-all assembly where adjustment is made through adjustment of the chin straps and several ballistic shell <b>102</b> sizes may be provided. Still further, the bump shell <b>104</b> and ballistic shell <b>102</b> may be a single size and the suspension assembly <b>106</b> may be adjusted for suitable fit, where the head side <b>116</b> of the impact protection element <b>112</b> is provided in several sizes and the shell side <b>118</b> of the impact protection element <b>112</b> is provided to fit in a single size bump shell <b>104</b>. Other combinations can be provided.</p>

<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present application relates to an article of headwear and, more particularly, to a helmet for protecting a human head.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The United States military has a history of providing a variety of headgear for military personnel. During World War II, the military standard issue included the M1 helmet. The M1 helmet included a &#x201c;steel pot&#x201d; portion made of metal and a liner that nestled inside the steel pot. The M1 helmet was a &#x201c;one-size-fits-all&#x201d; type helmet, where the size was fitted by adjusting the liner. In the early 1980's, advances in material caused the M1 helmet to give way to the Personal Armor System for Ground Troops (PASGT), which included a Kevlar helmet and vest. The PASGT helmet was produced in five sizes and, while offering more protection than the M1 helmet, still weighed about the same. More recently, the PASGT helmet has given way to the Modular Integrated Communications Helmet (MICH), the Advanced Combat Helmet (ACH), and the Lightweight Helmet (LWH). The MICH is primarily used by Special Operations, the ACH is primarily used by the Army, and the LWH is primarily used by the Marines and the Navy. These later helmets, while an improvement over the steel pot type helmets of the World War II era, are still in need of improvements relating to weight and versatility.</p>

The bump shell may include a front and a mounting bracket secured to the front for removably attaching the night vision mounting arm to the bump shell. The assembly may also include a ballistic shell having a bottom forming an opening and a coupling mechanism for removably securing the ballistic shell to the bump shell when the ballistic shell is placed over the bump shell. The ballistic shell may include a front and a notch extending upwardly from the opening into the front for receiving the mounting bracket when the ballistic shell is placed over the bump shell so as to permit the night vision mounting arm to be attached to the bump shell during use of the ballistic shell.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In another embodiment, a ballistic headpiece for use by a human having a head may be provided. The headpiece may be used with a night vision mounting arm, a bump shell having a front, an interior suspension assembly for seating on the head of the human to permit the bump shell to be worn by the human, and a mounting bracket secured to the front of the bump shell for removably attaching the night vision mounting arm to the bump shell. The ballistic headpiece may include a ballistic shell having a bottom forming an opening and a coupling mechanism for removably securing the ballistic shell to the bump shell when the ballistic shell is placed over the bump shell. The ballistic shell may include a front and a notch extending upwardly from the opening into the front for receiving the mounting bracket when the ballistic shell is placed over the bump shell so as to permit the night vision mounting arm to be attached to the mounting bracket during use of the ballistic shell without removing the mounting bracket from the bump shell.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In yet another embodiment, a suspension assembly for use with a headpiece by a human having a head with frontal and parietal regions may include a unitary impact protection element adapted for seating on the head. The unitary impact protection element may have a front portion having a shape that closely contours at least the frontal region of the head and a top portion and rear portion together depending from the front portion and having a shape that closely contours the parietal region of the head. The suspension assembly may also include a mounting assembly for positioning the protection element on the head.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In still a further embodiment, a bump shell assembly for use with ancillary equipment adapters and a ballistic shell by a human to protect a head during combat may include an outer body having a bottom forming an opening adapted to receive the head of the human and a suspension assembly coupled to the body and at least partially disposed in the body for seating on the head so as to permit the body to be worn by the human during combat. The body may have an exterior convex surface and at least one recessed surface recessed below the convex surface for receiving the ancillary equipment adapters whereby the ballistic shell can be worn over the body when the ancillary equipment adapters are removed from the body.</p>

The bump shell <b>104</b> may also be adapted for attachment of devices, tools, or other equipment, such as, for example, a night vision arm <b>105</b> or ancillary equipment adapters <b>107</b>. The ballistic shell <b>102</b> may be worn to provide additional protection such as protection against bullets, shrapnel, or other impalements resulting from combat and as such, the headpiece assembly <b>100</b> may also be referred to as a ballistic headpiece <b>100</b>. The ballistic shell <b>102</b> may fit over the bump shell <b>104</b> and may include a coupling mechanism <b>108</b> for attaching the ballistic shell <b>102</b> to the bump shell <b>104</b>. The ballistic shell <b>102</b> may also be configured to accommodate one or more of the devices on the bump shell <b>104</b> to facilitate ease of placing and removing the ballistic shell <b>102</b> while also facilitating use of the devices while the ballistic shell <b>102</b> is in place. The headpiece assembly <b>100</b> may also include a rear attachment device <b>110</b> for connection to the bump shell <b>104</b> or the ballistic shell <b>102</b> and adapted for securing equipment to its surface.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The following detailed description describes each of the portions of the headpiece assembly <b>100</b>, in detail, beginning with the suspension assembly <b>106</b>, moving to the bump shell <b>104</b> and the ballistic shell <b>102</b>, and ending with a discussion of the rear attachment device <b>110</b>. While reference to the figures will be made to provide examples of what is being described, the detailed description is not limited to the embodiment shown in the figures.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The suspension assembly <b>106</b> may be described with general reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-11</figref>. The suspension assembly <b>106</b> may be adapted to support the headpiece <b>100</b> on a human head (not shown) by nesting within the bump shell <b>104</b>. As such, the suspension assembly <b>106</b> may also be referred to as the interior suspension assembly <b>106</b> as it may be positioned or disposed at least partially within the bump shell <b>104</b>. The suspension assembly <b>106</b> may include a unitary impact protection element <b>112</b> and a mounting assembly <b>114</b>. The unitary impact protection element <b>112</b>, or impact protection element <b>112</b>, may be configured to suitably rest on a human head and hold the bump shell <b>104</b> in a spaced-apart relationship relative to the human head. The mounting assembly <b>114</b> may be configured to secure the impact protection element <b>112</b> to a human head and allow for adjustment to suitably fit a human head.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">With regard to the impact protection element <b>112</b>, also referred to as the liner, foam liner, or spacer, several of the following elements may be included and will be described in detail. The element <b>112</b> may include a generally concave inner or head side <b>116</b>, a generally convex outer or shell side <b>118</b>, and a bottom forming an opening. The head side <b>116</b> may be adapted for seating on the human head and the shell side <b>118</b> may be adapted for nesting within the bump shell <b>104</b>. Additional elements may include vents <b>120</b> extending from the head side <b>116</b> to the shell side <b>118</b> and slots <b>122</b> and recessed areas <b>124</b> adapted for accommodating the mounting assembly <b>114</b>. Further elements of the impact protection element may include depressions <b>126</b>, <b>127</b> for accommodating fastening mechanisms to connect the impact protection element <b>112</b> to the bump shell <b>104</b> or to accommodate padding. Additionally, cavities <b>129</b> may be provided to accommodate a portion of the coupling mechanism <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Each of these elements will now each be described in detail. It is noted that several of the elements may be defined by their relation to the human head. By way of background, the human head includes several regions defined by the several bones that make up the human skull. One of these regions is a frontal region corresponding to the frontal bone of the skull in the forehead portion of the head. Another region is the parietal region corresponding to the parietal bone of the skull in the top and back portion of the head. Another region is the occipital region corresponding to the occipital bone of the skull in the lower back of the head. On opposing sides of the head, temporal regions are defined by a temporal bone of the skull.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The impact protection element <b>112</b>, or liner, may include areas corresponding to these several anatomic regions of the human head. For example, the impact protection element <b>112</b> may include a frontal area <b>128</b> corresponding to the frontal region of a wearer's head and a parietal area <b>130</b> corresponding to the parietal region of a wearer's head. In addition, the impact protection element <b>112</b> may include portions dividing up the several areas. For example, the impact protection element <b>112</b> may include a front portion <b>135</b> making up the frontal area <b>128</b> and a top portion <b>137</b> and rear portion <b>139</b> making up the parietal area <b>130</b>. Additional regions and portions within each region can be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">With particular regard to the head side <b>116</b> of the impact protection element <b>112</b>, reference is made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. The head side may be adapted to substantially cover the frontal region and parietal region of the human head. The head side <b>116</b> may have a contour in the front portion <b>135</b> reflecting that of the frontal region of the human head and a contour in the top portion <b>137</b> and rear portion <b>139</b> reflecting that of the parietal region of the human head. Accordingly, the transition <b>131</b> between the front portion <b>135</b> and the top portion <b>137</b> may be positioned at or near the corresponding transition in the frontal and parietal regions of the skull. The transition <b>133</b> between the top portion <b>137</b> and the rear portion <b>139</b> may be positioned along a line extending from the mid-squamous region on one side of the head to the mid-squamous region on the opposing side of the head. The head side <b>116</b> may include a front edge <b>132</b> configured to encroach the eyebrow area of the head and a rear edge <b>140</b> following the contour of the back of the head and configured for positioning at or just below the occipital protuberance. As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the head side <b>116</b> may include substantially curvilinear side edges <b>136</b> extending from the front edge <b>132</b> around the side of the head. As the side edge <b>136</b> extends away from the front edge <b>132</b>, a smooth upward curve may be provided in the temple region of the head causing the side edge <b>136</b> to extend a short distance upward before an additional smooth curve causes the side edge <b>136</b> to extend toward the rear again. The side edge <b>136</b> may further extend toward the rear of the head following a path similar to that of the seam between the parietal bone and the temporal bone and, as such, curve downward along the rear edge of the temporal bone. The side edge <b>136</b> may extend along the side of the head to the rear edge <b>140</b> of the head side <b>116</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The head side <b>116</b> may be a generally continuous surface defined by the front portion <b>135</b> in the frontal area <b>128</b> and the top portion <b>137</b> and rear portion <b>139</b> in the parietal area <b>130</b>. However, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the head side <b>116</b> may be interrupted by openings to form vents <b>120</b> extending through the impact protection element <b>112</b>. The perimeter edge of the openings may include a radiused edge falling away from the surface of the head side <b>116</b> and intersecting with walls defining the vent <b>120</b> extending through the impact protection element <b>112</b>. One or more vents <b>120</b> may be provided. As shown, in one embodiment, four vents <b>120</b> may be provided and positioned in a radial array where the vents <b>120</b> are substantially equally spaced about the crown of the impact protection element <b>112</b>. As also shown, the array may be oriented such that one vent <b>120</b> is positioned in each of four quadrants defined by a longitudinal axis extending in a forward and rear direction and a transverse axis extending in a side to side direction. In other embodiments, other orientations can be provided. For example, a five vent arrangement may be provided similar to the four vent arrangement, but with an additional vent <b>120</b> positioned on a longitudinal axis of the assembly between the vents <b>120</b> in the rear portion <b>139</b> of the impact protection element <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The head side <b>116</b> may also include depressions <b>126</b> defining padding locations where comfort and/or absorbent pads may be adhered or otherwise secured to the impact protection element <b>112</b>. Other surface indentations and recesses may be provided. As shown best in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, one or more depressions <b>126</b> may be provided around the inner surface of the impact protection element <b>112</b>. In one embodiment, four depressions may be provided where two are positioned in the frontal portion <b>135</b> of the head side <b>116</b> and two are positioned along the lateral sides of the top portion <b>137</b> of the impact protection element <b>112</b>. Accordingly, when the mounting assembly <b>114</b> is tightened, the pads positioned in the depressions <b>126</b> may be drawn against the front and sides of the wearer's head. Other depression positions may also be provided including positions in the rear portion <b>139</b> of the impact protection element <b>112</b>. The depressions <b>126</b> may be relatively broad square, rectangular, trapezoidal or other shapes so as to accommodate relatively broad pads to suitably distribute loads and suitably absorb perspiration, while also allowing air flow between the impact protection element <b>112</b> and the wearer's head.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The shell side <b>118</b> of the impact protection element <b>112</b> may be generally convex and may share the front, rear, and side edges <b>132</b>, <b>140</b>, <b>136</b> with the head side <b>116</b> described. The surface of the shell side <b>118</b> of the impact protection element <b>112</b> may have a similar contour to the head side <b>116</b> or another contour can be provided. As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the longitudinal contour of the shell side <b>118</b> may be a substantially continuous contour extending from the front edge <b>132</b> to the rear edge <b>140</b> of the impact protection element <b>112</b> where the curvature of the shell side <b>118</b> in the front portion <b>135</b> is relatively sharp, the curvature through the top portion <b>137</b> is relatively mild and the curvature through the rear portion <b>139</b> is relatively sharp again. As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the transverse contour of the shell side <b>118</b> from one side edge <b>136</b> to the opposing side edge <b>136</b> may have a relatively sharp curvature as the surface extends from one side edge <b>136</b> up to the top of the parietal area <b>130</b> where the curvature may be relatively mild and, again, a relatively sharp curvature as the surface extends to the opposing side edge <b>136</b>. As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the surface contour of the shell side <b>118</b> of the impact protection element <b>112</b> may be configured for nesting within the bump shell <b>104</b> and, accordingly, may take on any surface contour similar to the bump shell <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The shell side <b>118</b> of the impact protection element <b>112</b> may be a generally continuous surface. However, like the head side <b>116</b>, the shell side <b>118</b> may be interrupted by openings to form vents <b>120</b> extending through the impact protection element <b>112</b>. The perimeter edge of the openings may include a radiused edge falling away from the surface of the shell side <b>118</b> and intersecting with walls defining the vent <b>120</b> extending through the impact protection element <b>112</b>. The shelf side <b>118</b> may also include depressions <b>127</b> defining securing locations where hook and loop securing elements (e.g., Velcro) can be placed, allowing the impact protection element <b>112</b> to be secured to the bump shell <b>104</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the shell side <b>118</b> surface may also include ballistic shell clip cavities <b>129</b> along rear edge <b>140</b>. The cavities <b>129</b> may be generally rectangular in shape and may be positioned generally symmetrically about a centerline of the impact protection element <b>112</b> and in a position corresponding to the clips <b>146</b> on an inner surface of the ballistic shell <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In addition, and as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5</figref>, <b>10</b>, and <b>11</b>, the shell side <b>118</b> of the impact protection element <b>112</b> may also include recessed areas <b>124</b> to accommodate straps <b>150</b> of the mounting assembly <b>114</b> described below. The areas <b>124</b> may extend across the shell side <b>118</b> surface of the impact protection element <b>112</b> and may have a width and depth the same as or slightly larger than the strap <b>150</b> allowing the strap <b>150</b> to lie in the channel without projecting above the shell side surface. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the shell side surface may include a slot <b>122</b> positioned at or near the end of a recessed area <b>124</b> that extends longitudinally along the shell side surface. The slot <b>122</b> may have a width and thickness slightly larger than a corresponding strap <b>150</b> allowing the strap <b>150</b> to be positioned through the impact protection element <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The impact protection element <b>112</b> can be made from an impact attenuating material. In one embodiment, the material is a foam material. More particularly, the foam may be an expanded polypropylene. Other foams, pads, insulations, or other attenuating material may be used. In one embodiment, the impact protection element <b>112</b> may be made from a single material. In other embodiments, the impact protection element <b>112</b> may include several materials in several layers or located in several locations.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In one embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref>, the impact protection element <b>112</b> may be made from a material with different densities. As such, the impact protection element <b>112</b> may include one or more density regions. As shown, the impact protection element may include a first density region <b>143</b>, a second density region <b>145</b>, and a third density region <b>147</b>. As shown, the density regions may correspond to the front, top, and rear portions <b>135</b>, <b>137</b>, <b>139</b> of the impact protection element <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Other arrangements of the density regions may be provided and the several densities may or may not correspond to the several portions of the impact protection element <b>112</b>. However, in some embodiments, the several densities may be particularly adapted to protect particular areas of the head and as such, the transitions between them may correspond to the seams between the regions of a wearer's head. That is, in the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref>, the density in the second density region <b>145</b> may be higher than that of the first and third density regions <b>143</b>, <b>147</b> in an effort to more thoroughly protect the top portion of the parietal region of the head, while also minimizing the weight by providing lesser densities in the first and third density regions <b>143</b>, <b>147</b>. The density of the material can be selected based on the type of material being used together with the level of protection desired. For example, the material may be an expanded polypropylene foam and the density of the density regions may range from approximately <b>1</b> pound per cubic foot to <b>5</b> pounds per cubic foot. In one embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref>, the first and third density regions <b>143</b>, <b>147</b> may have a density ranging from approximately <b>2</b>.<b>0</b> pounds per cubic foot to approximately <b>2</b>.<b>4</b> pounds per cubic foot. In this embodiment, the density of the second density region <b>145</b> may range from approximately <b>3</b>.<b>0</b> pounds per cubic foot to approximately <b>3</b>.<b>2</b> pounds per cubic foot. Other combinations of densities in the density regions can be used, such as the first and second density region having a higher density and the third density region having a lower density. Additionally, other combinations may include each density region having a different density or all three density regions having the same density. In still other embodiments, alternative numbers of density regions may be provided such as, for example, two density regions or more than three density regions.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The thickness of the impact protection element <b>112</b> can also be adjusted to provide suitable protection to the wearer's head. In some embodiments, the impact protection element may have a thickness between the outer and inner sides <b>118</b>, <b>116</b> ranging from approximately &#xbc; inch to approximately 3 inches. In another embodiment, the thickness may range from approximately &#xbc; inch to approximately 2 inches. In still another embodiment, the thickness may be approximately &#xbc; inch.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In one embodiment, the several materials can be adhered to one another to form the impact protection element <b>112</b> or the materials can be fused to form a monolithic element. It may be advantageous for purposes of better protection to construct the impact protection element <b>112</b> free of seams and joints. Accordingly, in one embodiment, the impact protection element <b>112</b> may be constructed by injecting beads into a mold from multiple ports, where the ports are positioned to place beads injected therethrough in a particular density region of the protection element <b>112</b>. For example, a port may be positioned in the second density region <b>145</b> and beads with a higher density may be injected through the port. In the first and third density regions <b>143</b>, <b>147</b>, additional ports may be provided through which lower density beads may be injected. Upon placement of the beads, the mold may be heated, steamed, or otherwise treated to fuse the beads in the several density regions of the impact protection element <b>112</b> together. In other embodiments, the several regions may be co-injected. Other processes can be provided to create a unitary impact protection element <b>112</b> between one or more of the materials used.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Turning now to the mounting assembly <b>114</b> of the suspension assembly <b>106</b> and referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the mounting assembly <b>114</b> may include a headband portion <b>154</b> and a strap portion <b>150</b>. The head band portion <b>154</b> may be configured for adjustably seating around the periphery of the human head and the strap portion <b>150</b> may be configured for engagement with the headband portion <b>154</b> and the impact protection element <b>112</b> to removably secure the impact protection element <b>112</b> to the headband <b>154</b>. As such, the mounting assembly <b>114</b> may removably secure the impact protection element <b>112</b> to the human head.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The headband portion <b>154</b> may include a frontal band <b>156</b> and a rear band <b>158</b>. The frontal band <b>156</b> may be configured for seating against the forehead of a human user and extending along the sides of the head. The frontal band <b>156</b> may include a relatively thin band type element with a width and having a plurality of perforations extending therethrough. The frontal band <b>156</b> may have a length similar to that of the distance from the mid-squamous region on one side of the human head extending along the side of the head across the brow line and returning to the opposing mid-squamous region. The rear band <b>158</b> may extend downward and rearward from the mid-squamous region and further be configured to extend around the rear of the human head below the occipital protuberance. The rear band <b>158</b> may include a non-linear discontinuity <b>160</b> positioned on either side of the band <b>158</b> as it extends around the rear sides of the back of the head allowing the rear band <b>158</b> to drop below the occipital protuberance and then extend across the rear side of the head. The rear band <b>158</b> may include two portions, one on each side of the mounting assembly <b>114</b> and being connected at the rear of the mounting assembly <b>114</b> by an adjustment mechanism <b>162</b>. The adjustment mechanism <b>162</b> may be configured to draw the two portions of the rear band <b>158</b> toward one another to tighten the headband <b>154</b> or allow the two portions to move away from one another to loosen the headband <b>154</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The strap portion <b>150</b> of the mounting assembly <b>114</b> may include one or more straps <b>150</b> extending from the headband <b>154</b> and extending upward and across the head to an opposing or other side of the headband <b>154</b>. The straps <b>150</b> can be adapted to nest in the recessed areas <b>124</b> described in the shell side <b>118</b> of the impact protection element <b>112</b>. The straps <b>150</b> can be relatively thin yet relatively wide so as to apply a relatively uniform pressure to the surface of the impact protection element <b>112</b> The straps <b>150</b> may intersect with the headband <b>154</b> in an overlapping condition and may be connected to the headband <b>154</b> with protruding tabs <b>164</b> that engage corresponding slots in the headband <b>154</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the mounting assembly may include three straps <b>150</b> extending from the headband <b>154</b> and meeting at a joint <b>166</b> positioned near the crown of the impact protection element <b>112</b>. As shown, side straps <b>150</b> may each extend from the opposing locations on the headband <b>154</b> where the frontal band <b>156</b> and the rear band <b>158</b> intersect. A front strap <b>150</b> may extend from a location at or near the middle of the frontal band <b>156</b>. All of the side and front straps <b>150</b> may extend to the crown area of the mounting assembly <b>114</b> and be connected to one another with a joiner <b>166</b>. In other embodiments, the three straps <b>150</b> may be integral with one another and, for example, be cut from an extruded membrane and a joiner <b>166</b> may not be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The mounting assembly <b>114</b> may be secured to the impact protection element <b>112</b> as best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> to form the suspension assembly <b>106</b>. The front strap <b>150</b> may be threaded through the slot <b>122</b> in the impact protection element <b>112</b> and the side straps <b>150</b> may be positioned to extend along the shell side surface of the top portion <b>137</b> of the impact protection element <b>112</b>. As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the straps may have a length configured to position a bottom edge of the frontal portion <b>156</b> of the headband <b>154</b> substantially flush with the front edge <b>132</b> of the impact protection element <b>112</b>.

<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Turning now to the ballistic shell <b>102</b>, reference can be made generally to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20-23</figref>. The ballistic shell <b>102</b> can be configured for nested positioning over the bump shell <b>104</b>. Accordingly, the ballistic shell <b>102</b>, also referred to as reinforcing shell, or protective shell, or outer shell, may have an outer surface having a generally convex shape similar to that of the outer body <b>168</b> of the bump shell <b>104</b>. The ballistic shell <b>102</b> may have a bottom forming an opening adapted for receiving the bump shell <b>104</b> and may have an inner surface opposite the outer surface defining a thickness therebetween. The outer surface of the ballistic shell <b>102</b> may have a contour substantially matching that of the bump shell <b>104</b> and may include a front edge <b>224</b> and a rear edge <b>228</b> configured for general alignment with corresponding edges of the suspension assembly <b>106</b> and bump shell <b>104</b>. The ballistic shell may also include side edges <b>226</b> that differ from the side edges <b>172</b> of the bump shell <b>104</b>. That is, the side edges <b>226</b> of the ballistic shell <b>102</b> may extend more directly from the front edge <b>224</b> along the sides of the shell <b>102</b> and then curve downward and around the rear of the shell. More particularly, a curved portion similar to the curved portion of the side edges <b>172</b> of the bump shell <b>104</b> near the temple region of the wearer may not be provided on the ballistic shell <b>102</b>. Rather, the side edges <b>226</b> may flare outward away from the bump shell <b>104</b> to provide overhanging regions configured for sheltering the ear area of a wearer. As shown, the ballistic shell may have a low cut ear portion. Other known ear portions such as medium cut and high cut ear portions can be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The ballistic shell <b>102</b> may be constructed of a protective material and more particularly, an unassailable or bulletproof material. The material may include steel or an aramid material, particularly a para-aramid such as Kevlar. Other materials may also be used. The ballistic shell <b>102</b> may include a notch <b>230</b> for accommodating the mounting bracket <b>176</b> on the bump shell <b>104</b> and a plurality of perforations <b>232</b> for attachment of ancillary equipment rails. In addition, the ballistic shell <b>102</b> or outer shell may include a second portion of the coupling mechanism <b>108</b> for coupling the ballistic shell <b>102</b> to the bump shell <b>104</b> and the ballistic shell <b>102</b> may also include a reinforced rim <b>234</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The notch <b>230</b> on the ballistic shell <b>102</b> may be configured for relatively tight positioning around the mounting bracket <b>176</b> of the bump shell <b>104</b> and may be further adapted for overlapping engagement with the ledge <b>196</b> of the reinforcing element <b>190</b> of the bump shell <b>104</b>. The notch <b>230</b> may be positioned to extend into the ballistic shell <b>102</b> from the front edge <b>224</b> and may have a geometry substantially the same as and slightly larger than the second tier <b>194</b> of the reinforcing element <b>190</b> on the bump shell <b>104</b>. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the ballistic shell <b>102</b> is positioned on the bump shell <b>104</b> and a cross-sectional view of the relationship of the notch <b>230</b> to the mounting bracket <b>176</b> and reinforcing element <b>190</b> is shown. As shown, the periphery <b>236</b> of the notch may have a cross-sectional shape adapted to overlap the ledge <b>196</b> provided by the first and second tiers <b>192</b>, <b>194</b> of the reinforcing element <b>190</b>. Along the periphery <b>236</b> of the notch <b>230</b>, the position of the outer surface of the ballistic shell <b>102</b> may be maintained, while the thickness of the ballistic shell <b>102</b> is reduced creating a lip-type edge <b>238</b> along the periphery <b>236</b> of the notch <b>230</b>. The lip <b>238</b> may have a width adapted to accommodate the first tier <b>192</b> extending beyond the second tier <b>194</b>. In some embodiments, the width of the lip <b>238</b> may be substantially the same as the width of the ledge <b>196</b> on the reinforcing element <b>190</b> allowing the ballistic shell <b>102</b> to overlap the reinforcing element <b>190</b> when the ballistic shell <b>102</b> is placed on the bump shell <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20-23</figref>, the ballistic shell <b>102</b> may include a plurality of perforations <b>232</b> for attachment of conventional ancillary equipment rails (not shown). Two perforations <b>232</b> may be positioned along the rear edge <b>228</b> of the ballistic shell <b>102</b> and two additional perforations <b>232</b> may be positioned along the side edge <b>226</b> of the ballistic shell <b>102</b> in the temple region. The perforations <b>232</b> may be threaded perforations and may be adapted to receive bolts or screws for attachment of rails configured to receive ancillary equipment adapters <b>107</b>. For example, a rail such as that currently sold by OPS CORE may be secured to the ballistic shell <b>102</b> via the perforations <b>232</b> shown. As such, the perforations <b>232</b> may be positioned to align with the fastening elements on the rail or another rail provided by a different manufacturer.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The second portion of the coupling mechanism <b>108</b> of the ballistic shell <b>102</b> may be configured to couple the ballistic shell <b>102</b> to the bump shell <b>104</b> by engaging the first portion of the coupling mechanism <b>108</b> positioned on the bump shell <b>104</b>. Accordingly, the second portion of the coupling mechanism <b>108</b> of the ballistic shell <b>102</b> may include clips <b>146</b> for engaging the slots <b>198</b> near the rear edge <b>228</b> of the bump shell <b>104</b> and ratchet surfaces <b>236</b> positioned to engage the corresponding ratchet surfaces <b>200</b> on the bump shell <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21 and 23</figref>, the clips <b>146</b> may include flexible tabs <b>238</b> positioned along the rear edge <b>228</b> of the ballistic shell <b>102</b>. The tabs <b>238</b> may be adhered or otherwise fastened to the inside surface of the ballistic shell <b>102</b> and may extend downward toward and/or beyond the rear edge <b>228</b> of the ballistic shell <b>102</b>. The tabs <b>238</b> may be fastened to the inside surface of the ballistic shell <b>102</b> with fasteners extending through the perforations <b>232</b> previously described and, as such, a single fastener can be used to retain the tabs <b>238</b> as well as an ancillary equipment rail, for example. The rear edge <b>228</b> of the ballistic shell may be flared outward causing the inside surface of the ballistic shell to diverge from the outside surface of the tab <b>238</b> and creating a gap therebetween. An engagement feature <b>240</b> may be positioned on the flexible tab <b>238</b> at a position corresponding to the position of the slots <b>198</b> on the bump shell <b>104</b>. The engagement feature <b>240</b> may include an additional tab or ledge directed inwardly from the flexible tab <b>238</b>. The engagement feature <b>240</b> may also be a hook or other feature for engaging the slot <b>198</b> on the rear side of the bump shell <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The ratchet surfaces <b>236</b> on the ballistic shell <b>102</b> may be the same or similar to those on the bump shell <b>104</b>, but may be oriented with a ratchet direction extending away from the front edge <b>224</b>. As such, the ratchet surfaces <b>236</b> may be in the form of ratchet strips positioned on the inside surface of the ballistic shell <b>102</b> in a position corresponding to the ratchet surfaces <b>200</b> on the bump shell <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The rear attachment device <b>110</b> can be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24-28</figref>. The rear attachment device <b>110</b> may be configured for attachment to the back of the bump shell <b>104</b> or the ballistic shell <b>102</b>. The rear attachment device <b>110</b> may include a securing surface <b>242</b> for attachment of equipment. The rear attachment device <b>110</b> may also include a securing mechanism <b>244</b> connected to the securing surface <b>242</b> for securing the device <b>110</b> to a shell <b>102</b>, <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The securing surface <b>242</b> of the rear attachment device <b>110</b> may be a substantially flat surface adapted for adjacent placement of equipment such as a battery pack, radio, or other equipment mountable to a flat surface. The securing surface <b>242</b> may have a size slightly smaller than an area defined by the rear projection of the bump shell <b>104</b>. The securing surface <b>242</b> may be generally rectangular in shape and one or more slots <b>246</b> may pass through the surface <b>242</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>, four slots are shown, two positioned adjacent each end of the securing surface <b>242</b>. The slots <b>246</b> may extend through the securing surface <b>242</b> and a strap cavity <b>246</b> may be provided behind each slot <b>246</b> to accommodate straps being passed through the slots <b>246</b> and around the end of the securing surface <b>242</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The securing mechanism <b>244</b> of the rear attachment device may include one or more hooks <b>250</b> for engaging a bottom edge of the shell and a concave surface <b>252</b> substantially conforming to the outer surface of the bump shell <b>104</b> and the ballistic shell <b>102</b>. The one or more hooks <b>250</b> may extend downward from the securing surface <b>242</b> and have a hook configured to engage the rear edge of the shell. As shown, two hooks <b>250</b> may be provided and the hooks <b>250</b> may be spaced apart from one another and have a width suitable for engaging the rear edge of the shell. The hooks <b>250</b> may be arranged to follow the curvature of the rear edge of the shell and as such may be oriented at an angle relative to the securing surface <b>242</b> as best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>. The concave surface <b>252</b> may be positioned opposite to the securing surface <b>242</b> as best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>. The concave surface <b>252</b> may have a contoured surface similar to the rear parietal area of the bump shell <b>104</b> and the ballistic shell <b>102</b>. The concave surface <b>252</b> may be positioned substantially flush with the top edge of the securing surface <b>242</b> and extend downwardly for a portion of the height of the securing surface <b>242</b>. The concave surface <b>252</b> may include an adhering feature such as hook and loop, adhesive, or other feature configured to removably secure the concave surface <b>252</b> to the convex surface of the shell.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">In operation and use, a wearer can use the headpiece assembly <b>100</b> in at least two general ways at different times. That is, the wearer can wear the bump shell <b>104</b> alone or the wearer can wear the bump shell <b>104</b> together with the ballistic shell <b>102</b>. This flexibility of allowing the bump shell <b>104</b> to be worn alone provides the advantage of offering protection against relatively minor injuries such as bumps, bruises, or even concussions, without the need to wear the heavier ballistic protection <b>102</b>, which may be more suitable for preventing more serious or even deadly injuries to the head.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">When wearing the bump shell <b>104</b> alone, the bump shell <b>104</b> may be placed upon the wearers head and chin straps extending from the securing elements <b>182</b> on the bump shell <b>104</b> may be fastened around a wearer's chin. The bump shell <b>104</b> may be worn, for example, by a soldier during exercises, drills, or other activities when otherwise not in combat or even simulated combat. The suspension assembly <b>106</b> of the bump shell <b>104</b> may be attached to the interior surface of the bump shell <b>104</b> by a hook and loop, or other adhering system. As such, the suspension assembly <b>106</b> may be removed from the bump shell for maintenance or replacement.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">As shown best in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18 and 19</figref>, the bump shell <b>104</b> can be used with a night vision system and other ancillary equipment. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, a night vision arm <b>105</b> can be attached to the mounting bracket <b>176</b> positioned on the front of the bump shell <b>104</b>. The night vision mounting arm <b>105</b> may be positioned on the mounting bracket by actuating the lever <b>188</b> and sliding the mounting plate under the retaining elements <b>186</b> of the mounting bracket <b>176</b>. Once the mounting plate clears the lever <b>188</b>, the lever <b>188</b> can be released thereby securing the mounting arm <b>105</b> to the mounting bracket <b>176</b>. The wearer can then rely on the night vision as desired by rotating the night vision arm <b>105</b> down in front of the wearer's face to allow sight through night vision goggles.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">In addition, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, ancillary equipment adapters <b>107</b> can be attached to the recessed channels <b>210</b> on the sides of the bump shell <b>104</b>. These adapters <b>107</b>, such as, for example, ACH-ARC Adapters provided by OPS CORE, may be slid into the front or rear of the channels <b>210</b> and secured with the OPS CORE catches (not shown), which may engage the perforations or recesses <b>216</b>, <b>218</b>. For example, a Picatinny adapter, which may engage the perforations <b>216</b>, or a Wing-loc adapter, which may engage the perforations <b>218</b>, may be used. In other embodiments, other adapters <b>107</b> can be slid into the channels <b>210</b> and secured with set screws, spring pins, or any other restraining type mechanism. The adapters <b>107</b> can then be used to secure flash lights, strobes, or other equipment to the headpiece <b>100</b> for use by the wearer.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Adding still further versatility, the rear attachment device <b>110</b> may be attached to the bump shell <b>104</b> by hooking the hooks <b>250</b> of the device <b>110</b> under the rear edge <b>174</b> of the bump shell <b>104</b> and pressing the concave surface <b>252</b> of the device <b>110</b> against the back of the bump shell <b>104</b>. Hook and loop materials, such as Velcro, can be used to secure the concave surface <b>252</b> to the bump shell <b>104</b>. Once in place, batteries, radios, or other equipment requiring a flat surface for attachment may be secured to the securing surface <b>252</b> of the rear attachment device <b>110</b>. The rear attachment device <b>110</b> may be magnetized to secure equipment or hook and loop material or even tape can be provided on the securing surface <b>242</b>. In addition, or alternatively, straps and/or tape can be inserted through the slots <b>246</b> on each end of the securing surface <b>242</b> and equipment can be strapped to the securing surface <b>242</b> of the rear attachment device <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">When the wearer desires or requires more protection than that provided by the bump shell <b>104</b>, the wearer may place the ballistic shell <b>102</b> over the bump shell <b>104</b>. If ancillary equipment adapters <b>107</b> are in place on the bump shell <b>104</b> or the rear attachment device <b>110</b> is in place on the bump shell <b>104</b>, these items may be removed to provide a clean surface over which to place the ballistic shell <b>102</b>. It is noted that the night vision arm <b>105</b> may remain attached to the bump shell <b>104</b> for placement of the ballistic shell <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">To place the ballistic shell <b>102</b>, the wearer may place the engagement features <b>240</b> of the clips <b>146</b> on the ballistic shell <b>102</b> into the slots <b>198</b> near the rear edge of the bump shell <b>104</b>. The wearer may then rotate the ballistic shell <b>102</b> forward over the bump shell <b>104</b> causing the ratchet surfaces <b>236</b> on the inside surface of the ballistic shell <b>102</b> to engage the ratchet surfaces <b>200</b> on the front portion of the bump shell <b>104</b>. The wearer can pull down on the ballistic shell <b>102</b> to secure the ballistic shell <b>102</b> by passing the ratchet surfaces <b>200</b>, <b>236</b> along one another to engage the ratchet teeth <b>202</b>. It is noted that the tapered shape of the side edges of the notch <b>230</b> in the ballistic shell <b>102</b> allow for the notch to pass down around the mounting bracket <b>176</b> without undue friction. That is, were the side edges oriented in a more vertical fashion, the edges may need to slide along the mounting bracket <b>176</b> and the reinforcing element for proper positioning and the sliding motion may cause the sides of the notch <b>230</b> to catch as the notch passes down around the mounting bracket <b>176</b>. When the ballistic shell <b>102</b> is placed upon the bump shell <b>104</b>, it is further noted that the lip <b>238</b> along the periphery <b>236</b> of the notch <b>230</b> of the ballistic shell <b>102</b> may overlap with the ledge <b>196</b> on the reinforcing element <b>190</b> of the bump shell <b>104</b>. As such, impalements directed toward the seam between the mounting bracket <b>176</b> for the night vision arm <b>105</b> and the edge of the ballistic shell <b>102</b> may be arrested by the first tier <b>192</b> of the reinforcing element <b>190</b> passing behind this seam.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Upon placing the ballistic shell <b>102</b>, the wearer may replace the rear attachment device <b>110</b> upon the headpiece assembly <b>100</b> by engaging the hooks <b>250</b> of the device <b>110</b> along the rear edge of the assembly <b>100</b> and pressing the concave surface <b>252</b> of the device <b>110</b> against the rear parietal region of the surface of the ballistic shell <b>102</b>. As with the attachment to the bump shell <b>104</b>, hook and loop or other systems can be used to adhere or attach the concave surface <b>252</b> to the surface of the ballistic shell <b>102</b>. In addition, ancillary equipment rails such as, for example, OPS CORE ACH-ARC rails, may be attached to the ballistic shell <b>102</b> by bolting the rails to the perforations <b>232</b> positioned on the ballistic shell <b>102</b>. Where the clips <b>146</b> on the ballistic shell are bolted in place, as opposed to adhered or otherwise secured to the inner surface of the ballistic shell <b>102</b>, a single bolt can be used to secure the rear portion of the rail and the clips <b>146</b>. Ancillary equipment adapters <b>107</b> such as, for example, ACH-ARC adapters as described with respect to the bump shell <b>104</b> may be positioned on and attached to the rails. Ancillary equipment may then be supported on or mounted to the adapters <b>107</b> or directly to the rails. As for the night vision arm <b>105</b>, the notch <b>230</b> in the ballistic shell <b>102</b> allows the placement of the ballistic shell <b>102</b> without affecting the position or use of the night vision arm <b>105</b> and it thus, may be used in the same fashion as when the bump shell <b>104</b> is worn alone.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">When a wearer desires to remove the ballistic shell <b>102</b>, the wearer may reach upward underneath the assembly and grasp the clips <b>146</b> extending downward from the rear edge <b>228</b> of the ballistic shell <b>102</b>. The divergence of the flared rear edge <b>228</b> of the ballistic shell <b>102</b> from the outside surface of the clips <b>146</b> may allow the user to squeeze the clips <b>146</b> toward the inner surface of the ballistic shell <b>102</b> thereby releasing the engagement features <b>240</b> on the clips <b>146</b> from the slots <b>198</b> in the bump shell <b>104</b>. Upon releasing the engagement features <b>240</b>, the rear portion of the ballistic shell <b>102</b> may be lifted causing the ballistic shell <b>102</b> to rotate forward on the wearer's head and release the ratchet surfaces <b>236</b> near the front of the assembly <b>100</b>. The wearer may then replace any ancillary equipment adapters <b>107</b> and/or rear attachment devices <b>110</b> on the bump shell <b>104</b> as desired.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">While the headpiece assembly has been described in detail above, several alternatives will be apparent to those of skill in the art and these alternatives are within the scope of the invention. For example, the securing surface <b>252</b> on the rear attachment device <b>110</b> may be round, triangular, or other shapes. It may also have a concave, convex, or other contour adapted to engage particular types of equipment. Still further, the slots <b>246</b> in the securing surface <b>252</b> of the rear attachment device <b>110</b> could be loops, clips, or other devices for securing straps.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">In still other embodiments, the bump shell <b>104</b> and the ballistic shell <b>102</b> may be configured for use with varying sizes of one or the other. That is, the bump shell <b>104</b> may be provided in a variety of sizes and the ballistic shell <b>102</b> may be provided in a single size where the ratchet connection of the ballistic shell <b>102</b> to the bump shell <b>104</b> allows for a tight fit of several sizes. In other embodiments, the bump shell <b>104</b> may be a one-size-fits-all assembly where adjustment is made through adjustment of the chin straps and several ballistic shell <b>102</b> sizes may be provided. Still further, the bump shell <b>104</b> and ballistic shell <b>102</b> may be a single size and the suspension assembly <b>106</b> may be adjusted for suitable fit, where the head side <b>116</b> of the impact protection element <b>112</b> is provided in several sizes and the shell side <b>118</b> of the impact protection element <b>112</b> is provided to fit in a single size bump shell <b>104</b>. Other combinations can be provided.</p>

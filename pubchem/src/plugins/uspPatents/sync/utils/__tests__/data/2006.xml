<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention is broadly concerned with improved headsets for aircraft crew members which are comfortable to wear and include shiftable mask and visor units which can be automatically or manually moved from a retracted position over the crown of the wearer&apos;s head to lowered, deployed positions. In this way, little or no crew member effort is required in emergency situations such as flight deck depressurization or smoke in the flight deck, so that the crew may very rapidly receive breathable gas and have eye protection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Prior Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Pursuant to government regulations, passenger aircraft flight decks are provided with emergency oxygen equipment which is used by the air crew in the event of an emergency such as a depressurization or smoke in the flight deck. Such equipment generally includes a mask (either full-face or covering the nose and mouth region of a wearer) which is stowed adjacent the crew member. When an emergency occurs, the mask is grasped, pulled from stowage and donned by the crew member. The mask is coupled with an oxygen supply hose so that emergency oxygen, or an air-oxygen mixture, is delivered to the mask. Typically, emergency masks of this type must be capable of being donned within five seconds. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> U.S. Pat. No. 4,915,106 describes a crew oxygen mask having an inflatable harness. That is, when the mask is pulled from stowage, the harness straps are inflated and assume a substantially enlarged configuration allowing the mask assembly to be rapidly placed over the user&apos;s head. Thereupon, a valve mechanism is actuated to deflate the harness straps so that the harness tightens and securely holds the mask in place. The &apos;106 patent further describes a comfort control feature allowing the crew member to adjust the effective tension of the harness straps. U.S. Pat. No. 3,599,636 discloses a similar harness-inflation mask assembly. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> While these types of crew oxygen masks can permit rapid mask donning, the crew member must find the mask, pull it out of stowage and put it on before the emergency can be addressed. Depending upon aircraft altitude, a slow response on the part of the crew member or failure to recognize oxygen depletion can lead to catastrophic results. Moreover, inflatable harness masks require a rather large and bulky stowage device and related equipment, which must be situated in relatively close proximity to each crew member. This takes up valuable space within the already-crowded crew flight deck, and moreover increases aircraft weight. Finally, in large commercial aircraft the oxygen hoses associated with conventional masks have become rather long, which again dictates that the stowage device must be of considerable size. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Another hazard sometimes encountered in the flight deck is the presence of smoke, which may result from an electrical fire or the like. While existing crew oxygen equipment supplies breathable gas to the crew members during smoky conditions, the presence of smoke can cause irritation to the eyes (if a half face mask is worn) or significantly obscure the crew member&apos;s vision. In light of this problem, a number of visors or other eye protective devices have been proposed. However, in many cases the supplemental smoke-protection equipment takes up still further valuable deck space and requires additional donning time. In large commercial aircraft, there are multiple locations of stowed equipment which may result in the equipment being misplaced, lost, stolen or damaged. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> There is accordingly a need in the art for improved air crew emergency oxygen and smoke protection equipment which eliminates the need for separate stowage devices and long supplemental oxygen hoses typical of inflatable-harness masks, but which retain the ability to be deployed in a very rapid fashion during flight deck emergencies. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The present invention overcomes the problems outlined above and provides compact, comfortable to wear crew headsets which have selectively usable mask and visor units shiftable from upper stored positions atop the wearer&apos;s head to lowered, deployed positions. Broadly speaking, the headsets of the invention include a mounting assembly which supports the movable mask and visor units as well as a pneumatically or electrically operated motive and control assembly. Mask and visor unit movement can be effected manually or automatically via control buttons or the like, or aneroid or voice command operators, or smoke detectors. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> In one preferred form, the mask unit includes an inflatable mask body or preformed face seal which when deployed will engage the nose and mouth region of the user; a gas passageway provides breathable gas to the inflated mask. The mask unit also includes means to prevent entrance of smoke into the headset. This may comprise a series of inwardly directed pressurized air curtain outlet passageways, or flexible sheet-like or bristle barriers on opposite sides of the inflatable mask. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The visor unit has a transparent lens and may also include a series of air curtain outlet passageways along the upper periphery thereof. Pressurized gas is directed to the outlet passageways to create an air curtain directed toward the user&apos;s forehead. In this way, the ingress of smoke into the visor unit is prevented. An inflatable bellows or flexible curtain may be used in lieu of the air curtain passageways for the same purpose. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> Deployment of the mask and visor units is very rapid, and the necessity of physically grasping, donning and adjusting a mask in emergencies is entirely eliminated.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0063" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0063&rsqb;</number> Turning now to the drawings, a preferred headset <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> in accordance with the invention is illustrated in FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>45</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight>. Broadly speaking, the headset <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> includes a head mounting assembly <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, a mask unit <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, visor unit <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, and a motive and control assembly <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> (see FIGS. <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>21</bold></highlight>). The headset <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> is designed to be worn by a user <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight> so that the mask and visor units <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> may be selectively maintained in a retracted position (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) or, in the event of an emergency situation, may be deployed (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0064" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0064&rsqb;</number> In more detail, the mounting assembly <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight> includes a pair of opposed ear pieces <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> oriented to cover the ears of user <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>, together with an arcuate strap assembly <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> extending between the ear pieces <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and designed to extend over the crown of the user&apos;s head. The ear piece <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> includes an upper, open-ended slot <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight> as well as fittings <highlight><bold>70</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>72</bold></highlight> respectively for coupling of an oxygen line <highlight><bold>74</bold></highlight> and electrical lead <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> (see FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>). The exterior face of the ear piece <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> is equipped with a regulator selector knob <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight> and regulator air entrance slots <highlight><bold>79</bold></highlight>, as well as actuator buttons <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> for operation of the mask and visor units <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, respectively. The opposed ear piece <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is similar, having an upper, open-ended slot <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>; this ear piece also pivotally supports a selectively deployable microphone <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> and a retinal scanning display device <highlight><bold>88</bold></highlight>. The inner faces of each of the ear pieces <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is provided with circumscribing padding <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> and earphone <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>. Such display devices and the use thereof in crew masks is fully described in copending and concurrently filed application entitled &ldquo;Aviation Crew Mask with Retinal Scan Instrument Display for Smoke in Cockpit Emergencies&rdquo;, S/N ______, filed Jul. 2, 2001. The inner faces of each of the ear pieces <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> is provided with circumscribing padding <highlight><bold>90</bold></highlight> and ear phone <highlight><bold>92</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0065" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0065&rsqb;</number> The strap assembly <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> includes a stationary, arcuate strap <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> connected to and extending directly upwardly from the ear pieces <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, so that the strap passes directly over the crown of the user&apos;s head. In addition, the assembly <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> has a movable strap <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> pivotally coupled to the ear pieces <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> and shiftable within the slots <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> between a retracted or stowed position adjacent stationary strap <highlight><bold>94</bold></highlight> to a deployed position passing around the back of the user&apos;s head (see FIGS. <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>). Selective movement of the strap <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> is effected during shifting of mask unit <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> as will be described below. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0066" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0066&rsqb;</number> The mask unit <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> includes an arcuate, generally U-shaped rigid body <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> presenting a pair of side arms <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> and a central bight section <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. The latter has a series of exhale slots <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>, as well as a recess <highlight><bold>108</bold></highlight> for receiving the end of microphone <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight>. The inner end of each arm <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is located within a corresponding ear piece <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight>, i.e., the arms <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> extend into the slots <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight> and are pivotally connected to the ear piece via pins <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>). The arm <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is provided with a breathable gas passageway <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> terminating in an outlet <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>, as well as a smaller mask inflation conduit <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> which extends to the area of bight section <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight> and terminates in an inflation opening <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight>. Finally, both of the arms <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> are provided with elongated slots <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> which receive corresponding, manually operable slide lugs <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> which are important for purposes to be made clear. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0067" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0067&rsqb;</number> The overall mask unit further includes a flexible, resilient, inflatable, bellows-type mask body <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> which is mounted to the inner face of U-shaped rigid body <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>, at the region of central bight section <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>. To this end, the center of mask body <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> includes a projecting bead <highlight><bold>126</bold></highlight> which is received within a formed channel <highlight><bold>128</bold></highlight> in the inner face of U-shaped body <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>. The outboard ends of the flexible mask body <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> are connected to the slide lugs <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0068" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0068&rsqb;</number> The mask body <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> is configured so that it may be inflated for use. Specifically, in the retracted position of mask unit <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, the body <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> is not inflated (see, e.g., <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>). However, when the unit <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is in its lowered, deployed position, the mask body <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> is inflated by passage of pressurized gas through conduit <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>. This action serves to inflate the mask as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> so that the inboard surfaces thereof contact the user&apos;s face and cover the nose and mouth area. Inflation of the mask <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> in this fashion causes the ends of the mask coupled with slide lugs <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> to move along the length of the arms <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, until the inflated mask extends around and covers the nose and mouth area and face areas on opposite sides thereof as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference>. In the event that the user wishes to manually extend the mask body <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>, or a hangup occurs, the slide lugs <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> may be manually shifted rearwardly along the respective slots <highlight><bold>116</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>118</bold></highlight> so that the mask body <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> will assume the <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> position. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0069" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0069&rsqb;</number> As is conventional with many mask units, the unit <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> includes a central exhale opening <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> formed in the rearward face of bight section <highlight><bold>104</bold></highlight>, in opposition to the exhale slots <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. The opening <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> is normally closed by a diaphragm <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight>, the latter biased towards the closed position by means of spring <highlight><bold>134</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0070" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0070&rsqb;</number> The visor unit <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> also includes a somewhat U-shaped main body <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> having elongated side arms <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> which are likewise received within ear piece slots <highlight><bold>68</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>84</bold></highlight>; the inboard ends of the arms <highlight><bold>138</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>140</bold></highlight> are similarly pivotally supported within the ear piece slots. The body <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> may alternately be equipped with an internal conduit <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> as well as a series of laterally spaced apart gas outlet passageways <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> along the inner face thereof (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>). The visor unit also includes a &ldquo;wrap around&rdquo; transparent synthetic resin lens <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> which is supported and depends from body <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>. It will be observed that the lower end of the lens <highlight><bold>146</bold></highlight> is complemental with the upper surface of U-shaped mask body <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0071" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0071&rsqb;</number> The motive and control assembly <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> is housed within ear piece <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and is designed to effect manual or automatic phased deployment of the mask unit <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> (together with strap assembly <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>) and visor unit <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. That is, depending upon ambient conditions, the mask unit <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> may be deployed along with assembly <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>; however, if smoke conditions are encountered, the visor unit <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> may also be deployed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0072" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0072&rsqb;</number> In particular, the motive and control assembly <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> broadly includes mask and visor controllers <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>149</bold></highlight>, separate drivers <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> for the mask and visor units <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> respectively, and a gas delivery assembly <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight>. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 45 and 48</cross-reference>, it will be seen that the controllers <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>149</bold></highlight> are substantially identical and each include a pneumatic valve <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> coupled to pressurized oxygen source <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> via input lines <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight>, as well as output lines <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, and exhaust line <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight>. The valves <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> are shiftable by depression of actuator buttons <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, and also may be automatically operated through operation of a pressure-responsive aneroid <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight> in the case of controller <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight>, and a solenoid/smoke detector <highlight><bold>163</bold></highlight> in the case of controller <highlight><bold>149</bold></highlight>. As will be seen, operation of the valve serves to direct pressurized gas to the mask or visor drive mechanism for up or down operation thereof with corresponding exhaust in each case. Now referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</cross-reference>, it will be seen that the output lines <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>are coupled to the driver <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> for mask unit <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. An identical operator <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> (not shown) is also provided for operation of the visor unit <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. In this instance, the drive mechanism <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> includes a double acting pneumatic piston and cylinder assembly <highlight><bold>164</bold></highlight> having an internal piston <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight> and an outwardly projecting piston rod <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight> equipped with rack <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight>. The overall drive mechanism includes a pair of gears <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> which are respectively coupled to arm <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> of U-shaped mask body <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> and to movable mounting strap <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>; these gears are in mesh with rack <highlight><bold>170</bold></highlight> as shown. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0073" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0073&rsqb;</number> It will thus be appreciated that upon movement of piston <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight> as dictated by passage of pressurized gas through line <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> and exhaust through line <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight>, the rod <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight> is extended, thereby causing the gears <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> to rotate to simultaneously move the mask unit <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and strap <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> to their deployed positions illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> for example. A similar rack and gear drive mechanism is employed for the selective movement of visor unit <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> between the retracted and deployed positions thereof. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0074" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0074&rsqb;</number> The gas delivery assembly <highlight><bold>152</bold></highlight> is likewise housed within ear piece <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> and includes a block <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight> including the pressurized oxygen source <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> in the form of a reservoir, regulator <highlight><bold>178</bold></highlight>, valve <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> passageways <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>185</bold></highlight> and outlets <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>188</bold></highlight>. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>, it will be observed that the passageway <highlight><bold>185</bold></highlight> extends between the source <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> and regulator <highlight><bold>178</bold></highlight>, whereas the passageway <highlight><bold>182</bold></highlight> extends from the output of the regulator to outlet <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight>. The passageway <highlight><bold>184</bold></highlight> extends from source <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> through the valve <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> and terminates at outlet <highlight><bold>188</bold></highlight>. The valve <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> includes an outwardly projecting arm <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> received within opening <highlight><bold>192</bold></highlight> and a base <highlight><bold>194</bold></highlight>. A coil spring <highlight><bold>196</bold></highlight> serves to urge the valve outwardly as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0075" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0075&rsqb;</number> When the arm <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is in its lowered position, i.e., when the mask unit <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is moved to its deployed location, the breathable gas passageway <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> of the arm comes into communication with outlet <highlight><bold>186</bold></highlight>. Similarly, the inflation conduit <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> comes into communication with outlet <highlight><bold>188</bold></highlight>. Finally, movement of the arm <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> depresses valve arm <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight> against the bias of spring <highlight><bold>196</bold></highlight> so that the valve opens as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>. This allows pressurized oxygen to pass through the inflation conduit <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight> and outlet <highlight><bold>115</bold></highlight> so as to inflate the flexible mask body <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. Also, an appropriate breathable gas (e.g., either pure oxygen or a mixture of air and oxygen as dictated by the position of selector knob <highlight><bold>78</bold></highlight>) is deliverable via passageway <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> to mask outlet <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0076" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0076&rsqb;</number> In the event that the visor design of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> is employed, i.e., with air outlet openings <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> along the inner surface of the visor body <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight>, the ear piece <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> would include a block <highlight><bold>198</bold></highlight> as illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</cross-reference>. The block <highlight><bold>198</bold></highlight> includes all of the components of block <highlight><bold>176</bold></highlight> previously described (and such common components are identified by identical reference numerals), as well as a conduit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> extending from source <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> and terminating in an outlet opening <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>. The visor body conduit <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> extends along the length of body <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> in communication with the outlet passageways <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> and presents an inlet opening <highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight>. When the visor is lowered, the openings <highlight><bold>202</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>204</bold></highlight> come into communication for passage of pressurized oxygen to the visor. Although not shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</cross-reference>, the conduit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> may be valve-controlled via a valve <highlight><bold>180</bold></highlight> as in the case of conduit <highlight><bold>188</bold></highlight> of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0077" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0077&rsqb;</number> The operation of this embodiment proceeds as follows. First, the user dons the headset as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, with the assembly <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, mask unit <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and visor unit <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> in their retracted positions over the crown of the user&apos;s head. The microphone <highlight><bold>86</bold></highlight> may be deployed as shown for communication purposes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0078" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0078&rsqb;</number> In the event of a flight deck emergency, the mask unit <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and strap assembly <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> are deployed. This can be automatic in the case of a depressurization, which would be sensed by aneroid <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight>. Alternately, if the user perceives an emergency situation, the actuator button <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> may be depressed to achieve this result. In either case, the U-shaped mask body <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> carrying the flexible mask <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> is shifted downwardly until the position of <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> or <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</cross-reference> is reached. This involves actuation of valve <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> so as to direct pressurized oxygen from source <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight> to output line <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. This in turn serves to move piston <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight> and rod <highlight><bold>168</bold></highlight>, so that the intermeshed gears <highlight><bold>172</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>174</bold></highlight> rotate, thereby shifting the body <highlight><bold>98</bold></highlight> downwardly and also moving the shiftable strap <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> to the deployed position thereof shown in FIGS. <highlight><bold>9</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. As the arm <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> moves downwardly, it encounters the upper end of valve arm <highlight><bold>190</bold></highlight>, moving it against the bias of spring <highlight><bold>196</bold></highlight> to open the valve. This establishes flow communication with the inflation conduit <highlight><bold>114</bold></highlight>, which thereby initiates inflation of the mask body <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. This continues until the mask assumes the <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference> position, with the outer portions of the mask part body in engagement with the face of user <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. In the event that the inflation of the mask body <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> is obstructed or otherwise hangs up, the user may manually grasp the slide lugs <highlight><bold>120</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>122</bold></highlight> to pull these rearwardly and thus complete the deployment of the mask <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0079" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0079&rsqb;</number> Breathable gas flowing through the passageway <highlight><bold>112</bold></highlight> enters the inflated mask through opening <highlight><bold>113</bold></highlight> to provide breathable gas to the user. In this connection, flow of breathable gas can be continuous or on a demand basis, at the discretion of the designer. During exhalation (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</cross-reference>), the diaphragm <highlight><bold>132</bold></highlight> is shifted allowing exhale gas to pass through opening <highlight><bold>130</bold></highlight> and out the exhale slots <highlight><bold>106</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0080" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0080&rsqb;</number> If the emergency condition requires use of visor unit <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, the actuator button <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> may be depressed or automatic operation of valve <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> can be effected through the solenoid/smoke detector <highlight><bold>163</bold></highlight>. In either case, a visor driver <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is actuated to lower the entire visor unit; specifically, pressurized oxygen is directed through line <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>of the visor controller valve so as to shift the piston <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight> of the visor driver mechanism, thereby causing the visor unit to pivot downwardly to the position shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</cross-reference>. As indicated previously, the visor body <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> is pivotally coupled to both of the ear pieces <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>64</bold></highlight> by means of pivot pins <highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0081" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0081&rsqb;</number> If the <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference> embodiment is employed, making use of the associated block <highlight><bold>198</bold></highlight> and gas passageways <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>, pressurized oxygen is delivered through conduit <highlight><bold>200</bold></highlight> to conduit <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight>, with the result that generally horizontally directed airstreams <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> are created which extend towards and impinge upon the forehead of the user. A relatively low pressure stream of such gas effectively prevents the ingress of smoke into the visor unit <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0082" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0082&rsqb;</number> When the emergency condition is passed, the user may reverse the operation of the mask and visor units <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, so that the latter reassume their retracted positions. First, actuator button <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> is engaged to cause the visor control valve <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> to shift (<highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>to <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight>), which reverses the movement of piston <highlight><bold>166</bold></highlight> of the visor driver mechanism <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight>, so that the visor unit is pivoted upwardly to the retracted position thereof. Next, the button <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> is pushed, causing the mask body to deflate and reassume the collapsed condition thereof, and unit driver mechanism <highlight><bold>150</bold></highlight> is actuated to reverse the movement of both the mask unit <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and the strap assembly <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight> of head mounting assembly <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0083" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0083&rsqb;</number> The principles of the invention may be used in a variety of different type of mask and visor unit headsets. For example, attention is directed to FIGS. <highlight><bold>17</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>19</bold></highlight> which illustrate exemplary types of head mounting assemblies <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight>. In all other particulars, the depicted headsets correspond to that described above. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</cross-reference>, the head mounting assembly <highlight><bold>210</bold></highlight> includes a pair of substantially orthogonal stationary straps <highlight><bold>216</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>218</bold></highlight> which are fixedly secured to the ear pieces. It is contemplated that such straps may be adjustable for different head sizes, but would otherwise be stationary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0084" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0084&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18, a</cross-reference> skull cap <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> is employed as a part of the assembly <highlight><bold>212</bold></highlight>. Here again, the cap <highlight><bold>220</bold></highlight> is stationary and is secured to the ear pieces. As shown, the cap may be vented as at <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight> for comfort purposes. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</cross-reference>, the assembly <highlight><bold>214</bold></highlight> includes a pair of stationary straps <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight>. The latter passes around the rear of the head of the user whereas strap <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> extends upwardly and obliquely relative to the strap <highlight><bold>226</bold></highlight> to define a &ldquo;halo&rdquo; type of mounting assembly. Here again, the straps <highlight><bold>222</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>224</bold></highlight> are secured to the ear pieces and are stationary. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0085" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0085&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> depict other types of motive and control assemblies <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight>. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22 and 23</cross-reference>, the assembly <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight> includes previously described controller <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> as well as a drive assembly <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight>. The drive assembly <highlight><bold>236</bold></highlight> includes a piston and cylinder assembly <highlight><bold>246</bold></highlight> including cylinder <highlight><bold>248</bold></highlight>, piston <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> and outwardly extending piston rod <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight>. The rod <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight> is equipped with an outermost grooved annular head <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight>. An elongated tie element <highlight><bold>256</bold></highlight> is secured to the inner pivoted ends of the arm <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and strap <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> as shown. In each instance, the tie end is secured about the associated pivot connection, such as pivot pin <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> by way of torsion springs <highlight><bold>257</bold></highlight>. It will further be seen that the head <highlight><bold>254</bold></highlight> engages the tie element <highlight><bold>256</bold></highlight> intermediate the ends thereof, i.e., between the arm <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and strap <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</cross-reference> illustrates the apparatus in the retracted position, that is, where the mask unit is in its upper position. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</cross-reference> on the other hand depicts the configuration of the control assembly <highlight><bold>228</bold></highlight> upon deployment of the mask. That is, the controller <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> is operated either automatically or manually in order to send pressurized oxygen to cylinder <highlight><bold>248</bold></highlight>, thereby shifting piston <highlight><bold>250</bold></highlight> and rod <highlight><bold>252</bold></highlight> upwardly; such movement extends the tie element <highlight><bold>256</bold></highlight>, causing the arm <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> and strap <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> to be shifted downwardly. When it is desired to move the mask unit and strap <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> back to their retracted positions, the pressure within cylinder <highlight><bold>248</bold></highlight> is exhausted by appropriate manipulation of valve <highlight><bold>238</bold></highlight>. As this point, the torsion springs <highlight><bold>257</bold></highlight> serve to retract the mask unit and strap <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0086" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0086&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24 and 25</cross-reference> illustrate an alternative motive and control assembly <highlight><bold>230</bold></highlight> which includes a controller <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 45</cross-reference>) and a drive assembly <highlight><bold>258</bold></highlight> comprising four coaxial, rotatable disks <highlight><bold>259</bold></highlight>. The outboard disk <highlight><bold>259</bold></highlight> supports the arm <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, the next adjacent inner disk supports strap <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>. The next disk is simply an operator, whereas the innermost disk supports the main body <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> of visor unit <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. Each disk <highlight><bold>259</bold></highlight> includes an upper and a lower arcuate slot <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>which are in mated alignment with the slots <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>&prime; and <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>&prime; of the adjacent disk as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24 and 25</cross-reference> (depicting the outermost and next adjacent disk <highlight><bold>259</bold></highlight> for movement of the mask unit <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and strap <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> of strap assembly <highlight><bold>66</bold></highlight>). A short passageway <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight> extends from the base of the mated disk pair to the corresponding lower arcuate openings <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>&prime;. Similarly, a passageway <highlight><bold>262</bold></highlight> extends from this base to the upper arcuate openings <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>&prime;. The &ldquo;mask up&rdquo; output line <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>from controller <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> is coupled with passageway <highlight><bold>262</bold></highlight>, whereas mask down output line <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>is connected with passageway <highlight><bold>261</bold></highlight>. Although not shown in detail, it will be understood that the third and innermost disks <highlight><bold>259</bold></highlight> are configured in the same manner as the disks shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, and are coupled with a valve controller <highlight><bold>149</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48</cross-reference>). </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0087" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0087&rsqb;</number> In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference>, the headset is shown with the mask and visor units in their upper, retracted positions. In the event of a flight deck emergency, either by actuation of button <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> or via automatic control through aneroid <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight>, the valve <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> is shifted so that pressurized oxygen is directed to output line <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. This causes the pressurized oxygen to enter the small chamber <highlight><bold>263</bold></highlight> formed between the adjacent ends of the lower arcuate slots <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b</italic></highlight>, thereby rotating the disks in opposite rotational directions until the disks assume the <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</cross-reference> position. In this position, the arm <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is lowered along with strap <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>. A further consequence of this movement is the formation of another small chamber <highlight><bold>264</bold></highlight> between the adjacent ends of the upper mating arcuate slots <highlight><bold>260</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>. When it is desired to retract the mask unit <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>, it is only necessary to manipulate button <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight> to shift valve <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> so that pressurized oxygen is delivered to line <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and passageway <highlight><bold>262</bold></highlight> for delivery to chamber <highlight><bold>264</bold></highlight>. This in turn causes reverse relative rotation of the adjacent disks <highlight><bold>259</bold></highlight>, so that the strap <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight> and arm <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> are returned to their <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</cross-reference> retracted position. Of course, the operation of visor unit <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> is identical, in that the valve <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> of controller <highlight><bold>149</bold></highlight> is manipulated to alternately deliver pressurized oxygen to the output lines <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>or <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>for visor down and visor up operation. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0088" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0088&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</cross-reference> depicts a still further motive and control assembly <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight>. In this case, the assembly <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> includes stepper motors <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>272</bold></highlight> respectively mounted on the pivot pins <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>206</bold></highlight> associated with the mask unit <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> and visor unit <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, respectively. Additionally, the assembly <highlight><bold>232</bold></highlight> includes a pair of intermeshed gears <highlight><bold>274</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>276</bold></highlight> coupled to pin <highlight><bold>110</bold></highlight> and the pivot mount for movable strap <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>. The electrical lead <highlight><bold>76</bold></highlight> is connected to oxygen mask switch <highlight><bold>278</bold></highlight> which is in turn operably coupled with visor switch <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight>, as well as two limit switches <highlight><bold>282</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>284</bold></highlight>. The switches <highlight><bold>278</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight> are also operably coupled with the corresponding stepper motors <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>272</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0089" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0089&rsqb;</number> In operation, when the switches <highlight><bold>278</bold></highlight> and/or <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight> are actuated (either manually via the buttons <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight> or automatically through an aneroid or similar controller), an appropriate electrical signal is sent to the stepper motor <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight>, which causes arm <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> to pivot down and also, via the gears <highlight><bold>274</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>276</bold></highlight>, effects downward movement of the strap <highlight><bold>96</bold></highlight>. Up and down movement of the arm <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is controlled by means of the limit switches previously described. In the case of visor unit <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>, closing of switch <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight> causes actuation of stepper motor <highlight><bold>272</bold></highlight>, so that the visor unit is moved to its deployed condition. Of course, the stepper motors <highlight><bold>270</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>272</bold></highlight> may be reversed by appropriate manipulation of the switches <highlight><bold>278</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>280</bold></highlight>, to selectively retract the visor unit <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> and mask unit <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0090" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0090&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight> depict a further modified embodiment in accordance with the invention. In this instance, the mask unit <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is equipped with a series of lower, inwardly directed air passageways <highlight><bold>286</bold></highlight> similar to the visor passageways <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight> previously described (see <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</cross-reference>). Additionally, the mask unit has an elongated conduit <highlight><bold>288</bold></highlight> in communication with the passageways <highlight><bold>286</bold></highlight>. As illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</cross-reference>, when the mask unit <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is in its lowered, deployed condition, the conduit <highlight><bold>288</bold></highlight> comes into communication with a similar conduit <highlight><bold>290</bold></highlight> formed in block <highlight><bold>198</bold></highlight>, the latter being operatively coupled with pressurized oxygen source <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight>. Thus, as best seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</cross-reference>, when the mask and visor units are in their lower, deployed condition, upper and lower air currents <highlight><bold>208</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>292</bold></highlight> are directed from the passageways <highlight><bold>144</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>286</bold></highlight>, thereby preventing ingress of smoke into the mask and visor units. It will be observed (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</cross-reference>) that in this embodiment, the mask <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight> need only cover the nose and mouth region of the user, there being no need for the extensible side margins of the embodiment depicted for example in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</cross-reference> for the purpose of preventing ingress of smoke into the device. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0091" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0091&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 30 and 31</cross-reference> illustrate another mechanism used to prevent smoke ingress into the visor unit <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight>. In this instance, an expandable, elongated bellows <highlight><bold>293</bold></highlight> is provided, mounted to the inner face of body <highlight><bold>136</bold></highlight> and in communication with conduit <highlight><bold>142</bold></highlight> via opening <highlight><bold>294</bold></highlight>. As shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</cross-reference>, upon inflation of the bellows <highlight><bold>293</bold></highlight>, the inner surface thereof comes into engagement with the forehead of the user thereby preventing smoke ingress. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0092" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0092&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>37</bold></highlight> illustrate a modified embodiment in accordance with the invention, wherein the mask unit <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> has the central mask <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>, but with a pair of flexible synthetic resin or elastomeric skirts <highlight><bold>296</bold></highlight>,<highlight><bold>298</bold></highlight> secured to the opposite side margins of the mask body. Additionally, each of the arms <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is equipped with a substantially flat piston and cylinder assembly <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight>, cylinder <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>, piston <highlight><bold>304</bold></highlight> and selectively extensible piston rod <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight>; the rod <highlight><bold>306</bold></highlight> is in turn coupled with the adjacent skirt <highlight><bold>296</bold></highlight> or <highlight><bold>298</bold></highlight>. Appropriate pneumatic passageways <highlight><bold>308</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>310</bold></highlight> extend from opposite ends of the cylinder <highlight><bold>302</bold></highlight>, and communicate with appropriate conduits provided in block <highlight><bold>198</bold></highlight> (not shown). It will be appreciated that the assembly <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> mounted in arm <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight> is the master, whereas the assembly <highlight><bold>300</bold></highlight> mounted in arm <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight> is a slave. Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 36 and 37</cross-reference>, it will be seen that in the retracted position, the skirts <highlight><bold>296</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>298</bold></highlight> are spaced forwardly from the user&apos;s face. However, when deployed, the skirts are moved rearwardly as best seen in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</cross-reference>, in order to engage the cheek regions of the user. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0093" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0093&rsqb;</number> FIGS. <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>43</bold></highlight> depict a still further embodiment in accordance with the invention. In this instance, a pair of bristle assemblies <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> are provided on opposite sides of the mask body <highlight><bold>124</bold></highlight>. The assemblies <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight> are designed to be moved from the retracted position thereof shown in phantom in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</cross-reference> in close adjacency to the associated arms <highlight><bold>100</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>102</bold></highlight>, to the deployed position. Such movement is effected by the mechanism illustrated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 42 and 43</cross-reference>. Specifically, each of the bristle assemblies is mounted on a rotatable shaft <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> equipped with an outwardly projecting lug <highlight><bold>318</bold></highlight>. The end of the shaft <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> is coupled with piston <highlight><bold>320</bold></highlight>, housed within a pneumatic cylinder <highlight><bold>322</bold></highlight> having ports <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight>. The cylinder includes an elongated, tubular extension <highlight><bold>328</bold></highlight> having a spiral groove <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight> formed therein. The ports <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>326</bold></highlight> are operably coupled with the pneumatic system for the mask, so that, when it is desired to deploy the bristle assemblies <highlight><bold>312</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>314</bold></highlight>, pressurized oxygen is directed to the ports <highlight><bold>324</bold></highlight>, thereby causing the shaft <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> to follow the arcuate path defined by groove <highlight><bold>330</bold></highlight>; this causes the brush units to move from their retracted positions to their operative, lowered positions shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 40 and 41</cross-reference>, where the inner ends of the bristles engage the user&apos;s face. Retraction of the bristle assemblies involves simply a reversal of the foregoing procedure, so that the shafts <highlight><bold>316</bold></highlight> rotate in the opposite direction to move the associated bristle assemblies to their stored positions. <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 44, 47</cross-reference> and <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>49</bold></highlight> depict other types of controllers which can be used in lieu of the previously described controllers <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>149</bold></highlight>. Turning first to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 44 and 47</cross-reference>, it will be observed that the controllers <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight> for the mask and visor units includes a valve <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> as previously described, together with oxygen inlets <highlight><bold>156</bold></highlight>, lines <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight> and outlet lines <highlight><bold>158</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>, <highlight><bold>160</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>and exhaust lines <highlight><bold>161</bold></highlight>. In this case, the only operator for the valve assemblies <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> are the actuator buttons <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>. That is, this embodiment does not include any automatic operation as in the case of controllers <highlight><bold>148</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>149</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0094" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0094&rsqb;</number> Referring to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 46 and 48</cross-reference>, the controllers <highlight><bold>336</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>338</bold></highlight> for the mask and visor units are identical with the assemblies <highlight><bold>332</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>334</bold></highlight>, with the exception that automatic control is provided by means of a voice signal-actuated operator <highlight><bold>340</bold></highlight>. That is, actuation of the valve assemblies <highlight><bold>154</bold></highlight> may be effected manually by manipulation of the buttons <highlight><bold>80</bold></highlight>, <highlight><bold>82</bold></highlight>, through the aneroids <highlight><bold>162</bold></highlight>, solenoid/smoke detector <highlight><bold>163</bold></highlight> or by the user simply speaking the appropriate command such as &ldquo;drop mask&rdquo; or &ldquo;drop visor.&rdquo; In all other respects, the operation of these controllers is identical to that described in connection with <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 45 and 48</cross-reference>. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The invention relates generally to the field of martial arts, and particularly, though not limiting, to protective gear worn by participants in martial arts events. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> During martial arts competitions, practices, and sparring events, the participants often wear protective padding on certain body areas, including the hand and forearm areas and the foots and shin areas. The paddings provide protection to the wearer, as well as the wearer&apos;s opponent, when such opponent is struck by the wearer&apos;s hands or feet. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Currently, the hand and forearm pads are separate items, constructed independent of each other. Current pads typically use VELCRO&reg; fasteners and straps for tightening the pads on the wearer. With current paddings, several disadvantages are readily apparent. Putting on the separate pieces of padding is often difficult, and often one of the pieces is misplaced or lost. The VELCRO&reg; fasteners and straps are also difficult for younger users to properly manipulate. Additionally, the forearm pad is known to slide up or down the wearer&apos;s arm during use, thus, exposing areas of the wearer&apos;s arm, for which protection was initially sought. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> These same disadvantages are also found with current separate foot and shin pads, with the shin pad sliding up or down the wearer&apos;s leg. Additionally, where two separate pads are provided (hand/forearm and/or foot/shin) the cost of manufacturing is also increased. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> Thus, what is needed in the art is a one-piece hand/forearm pad and a one-piece foot/shin pad. It is therefore, to the effective resolution of the aforementioned problems and shortcomings that the present invention is directed. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> The present invention provides a combination one piece protective forearm and hand padding and a combination one piece protective foot and shin padding. The forearm protective portion is permanently attached to the hand/wrist protective portion preferably by stitching. Likewise, the foot/ankle portion is permanently attached to the shin portion preferably by stitching. The hand portion can include a grip bar and has finger loops attached to a outer surface for open handed wear. A &ldquo;v&rdquo; shaped notch is provided on the palm area of the hand portion and includes an elastic member for a comfortable, yet secure fit. The elastic member also eliminates the need for any straps and hook and loop fasteners, as is commonly found with conventional hand gloves. Additional padding can also be provided on the thumb area of the hand portion to provide additional protection to the wearer while he or she is punching an object. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The forearm and shin portions of the protective paddings incorporate elastic members for comfortable and securely positioning such portions on the wearer&apos;s arms and legs, respectively. The foot portion is provided with a toe holder for added support and also includes an extended tongue portion for additional protection. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> The one-piece construction reduces the cost of the paddings and extends the protection area of the wearer. Furthermore, the one-piece construction also prevents the forearm and shin portions from sliding or shifting up and/or down the wearer&apos;s arms and legs, respectively, as is commonly found with conventional forearm and shin pads. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a one-piece hand and forearm protective padding. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> It is another object of the present invention to provide a one-piece shin and foot protective padding. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> It is still another object of the present invention to provide a one-piece hand and forearm protective padding which does not use straps or hook and loop fasteners for attachment purposes. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> It is yet another object of the present invention to provide a one-piece hand and forearm protective padding, wherein the forearm portion will not slide or shift up or down the wearer&apos;s arm during use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> It is yet still another object of the present invention to provide a one-piece shin and foot protective padding, wherein the shin portion will not slide or shift up or down the wearer&apos;s leg during use. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> It is even still another object of the present invention to provide a one-piece hand and forearm protective padding which provides a greater area of protection to the wearer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> It is a further object of the present invention to provide a one-piece shin and foot protective padding which provides a greater area of protection to the wearer. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> It is still a further object of the present invention to provide a one-piece hand and forearm protective padding which is relatively easy to put on by the wearer, even where the wearer is a small child. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> It is still yet another object of the present invention to provide a one-piece shin and foot protective padding which is relatively easy to put on by the wearer, even where the wearer is a small child. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> In accordance with these and other objects which will become apparent hereinafter, the instant invention will now be described with particular reference to the accompanying drawings.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> The present invention relates generally to articles of clothing for an infant and, in particular, to clothing designed to provide additional traction for a crawling and/or walking infant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> Socks are one type of infant clothing. Dressing an infant with fabric socks is advantageous in many ways. Socks are aesthetically pleasing, keep the infant&apos;s feet warm and protect the infant&apos;s feet from minor cuts and abrasions. When the infant becomes ambulatory, however, socks can be disadvantageous on smooth floor surfaces, such as hardwood or linoleum floors, because there is a very low coefficient of friction between fabric material of the socks and the floor surface. This poses an increased risk of injury because the infant may slip and fall on the smooth surface while wearing only the fabric socks. Dressing the infant with shoes is one solution to this problem, but it is not always desirable, and is often difficult, to put shoes on an ambulatory infant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> This is a recognized problem, and many prior art infants socks, therefore, have been fitted with material that provides greater traction on the bottom of the sock. This material is also referred to as a gripper area. These prior art socks have worked well for those infants who have already progressed to walking, because the portion of the sock with the gripper area is in contact with the smooth floor surface. These prior art socks, however, have been disadvantageous for crawling infants, because typically the feet of crawling infants contact the floor surface with portion of the foot closest to the toes or the top of the foot, rather than the bottom of the foot. Because the top portion of the prior art socks did not contain a gripper area on the toes or top of the sock, the same problems were encountered as with socks without any gripper area, which results in an increased risk of injury to crawling infants wearing the prior art socks. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> It is desirable to provide an article of infant clothing that will provide greater traction for crawling infants as well as for infants that are already walking. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> It also is desirable to provide infant apparel that will protect the knees and elbows of crawling infants as well infants that are already walking. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> The present invention concerns infant apparel for use with a crawling and/or walking infant. For example, one article of infant apparel is a sock member with an upper surface, a lower surface, and a toe portion connecting and enclosing the upper and lower surfaces at a leading edge of the sock member. A traction device in the form of a gripper area is attached to the exterior portion of the sock member and preferably extends from the upper surface to the toe area and further to the lower surface. The gripper area is preferably a frictional material that has a greater coefficient of friction than the material forming the sock member. The sock member can be tubular or foot-shaped for ease of dressing the infant. Alternatively, the gripper area is formed in a tread pattern and can include transversely or circumferentially spaced ribs along the upper surface, toe portion, and lower surface. In either sock shape, the gripper area can extend to a side area of the sock to aid a crawling infant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The present invention recognizes that prior art socks were suitable neither for providing traction to crawling infants nor for reducing the risk of injury to crawling infants on smooth floor surfaces. With a gripper area at the top surface and toe portion of the sock member, the sock provides infants a greater ability to crawl on smooth surfaces, while reducing the risk of injury to the crawling infants. The present invention is also suitable for infants who have progressed to walking, because the gripper area extends to the lower surface of the sock member. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> In addition to socks, articles of clothing such as jumpers and pants can have the traction devices on both the feet and knee portions. Furthermore, pads can be provided in the knee portions to protect the infant&apos;s knees during crawling or in case of a fall during walking. The pads can be positioned on either the exterior or the interior of the material forming the article of clothing. The feet portions also can be detachable. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> The present invention is a novel improvement over the prior art because while the prior art teaches many different varieties of infant socks, none of the prior art teaches an infant sock or foot portion with a gripper area extending to the toe, the side area and the upper surface of the sock member for the purpose of providing traction to crawling infants.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Referring now to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</cross-reference>, an article of infant apparel or clothing such as an infant sock is shown generally at <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight>. The infant sock <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> includes a generally tubular sock member <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> having an exterior upper surface <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, an exterior lower surface <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, and an exterior toe surface <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> on the exterior thereof. The toe surface <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> defines an enclosed end of the sock member <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> opposite an open end for receiving an infant&apos;s foot (not shown). The sock member <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is preferably constructed of a natural fabric material, such as cotton, or a synthetic fabric material, such as nylon or spandex, or a combination of such materials. Preferably the infant sock <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is latex free. The upper surface <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and the lower surface <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> preferably consist of the same amount of fabric material so as to ensure a good fit on an infant&apos;s foot (not shown.) The infant sock <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is preferably sized to fit an infant learning to crawl. A typical age for such an infant is about four months of age to about one year of age. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> A traction device in the form of a gripper member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is adhered to the exterior lower surface <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, the exterior upper surface <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>, and the exterior toe surface <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Preferably the gripper member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> covers a continuous area of the sock member <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> including a lower portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>extending partially along the exterior lower surface <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>, a toe portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>extending along the exterior toe surface <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> and a top portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>extending partially along the exterior upper surface <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> of the sock member <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight>. The area covered by the gripper portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>on the exterior lower surface <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> is preferably greater than the area covered by the gripper portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>on the exterior upper surface <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight>. The gripper member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> preferably covers most, if not all, of the area of the exterior toe surface <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>. Alternatively, the gripper member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> covers a greater area on the exterior upper surface <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> than on the exterior lower surface <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. Also, the gripper member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> can extend along a side area where the surfaces <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> and <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> meet forming a side portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d. </italic></highlight>The gripper member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is preferably constructed of a material that increases the coefficient of friction with a floor surface, such as a rubberized material or the like, having a coefficient of friction greater than a coefficient of friction of the material from which the sock member <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> is made. The material of the gripper member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is flexible and withstands laundering. The material of the gripper member <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> may be adhered to the sock member <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> by a thermal process, such as an applique process. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0026" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0026&rsqb;</number> When crawling, an infant&apos;s feet are positioned upside down such that the toe portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>b </italic></highlight>and the upper portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>c </italic></highlight>come into contact with the floor surface providing traction. Often, the infant will turn his/her toes in or out causing the side portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>to contact the floor surface providing traction. When walking, the lower portion <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>contacts the floor surface providing traction. Thus, whether crawling or walking, the traction device <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> aids the mobility of the infant. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The sock member <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> also includes an annular elastic band <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> attached to the upper surface <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and lower surface <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> that forms the open end for receiving the infant&apos;s foot. The elastic band <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> also aids in keeping the sock member <highlight><bold>11</bold></highlight> in place on the infant&apos;s lower leg (not shown.) The elastic band <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> preferably includes a fabric sheath for comfort.

</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> The present invention concerns trousers for cyclists with an insert protecting the body zones of the cyclist resting against the bicycle saddle, with an insert made from at least a single piece and fastened at its borders to the fabric of the trousers, e.g. by stitching. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Discussion of Background Information </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Trousers for cyclists of similar type are known in practical use and are marketed worldwide e.g., by the company ASSOS SA at CH-6854 San Pietro di Stabio, Switzerland. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> Also from the patent literature, the use of trousers for cyclists with a protecting insert is known e.g. from EP-0776615-A2, published on Jun. 4, 1997. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0007" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0007&rsqb;</number> In the case of EP-0776615-A2, which represents the state of the art on which the present invention is based and which is hereby incorporated in its entirety by reference thereto, the protecting insert is made from natural or synthetic leather and presents a very specific shape in order to prevent the seams used for fastening the insert to the fabric of the trousers, from disturbing the cyclist in his action and causing painful, or at least bothersome abrasion. This type of insert for trousers for cyclists has proven itself useful with respect to the objectives for which it was laid out. It has been found however, that the relatively stiff material from which the inserts are made, in the sense of limited extensibility, still can cause discomfort to the user, as the insert cannot adapt sufficiently to the movements of the cyclist, especially to the leg movements, and thus tends to provoke undesirable stretching in certain zones of the cyclist&apos;s skin. This is due to the fact that the material chosen for the insert, i.e., natural or synthetic leather, presents very low elasticity values, usually below 10% and in many cases reaching hardly even a few per cent of elasticity. Repeated stretching of skin zones, which are very susceptible by nature in any event, such as the groin zones, can eventually cause local reddening and inflammation of the skin, which are very annoying for the cyclist. </paragraph>
</section>
<section>
<heading lvl="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0008" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0008&rsqb;</number> The present invention thus intends to eliminate these specific disadvantages of the trousers for cyclists provided with the known inserts and to permit realization of clothing for casual cyclists, as well as and especially for racing competition cyclists by providing optimum comfort and reliably avoiding any remaining danger of abrasion of delicate body zones particularly exposed while practicing this sport. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0009" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0009&rsqb;</number> This objective is met using the present invention by having the insert consist of a base layer made of expanded material, onto which, on the side directly contacting the body of the cyclist, a fabric, elastic in all directions is fastened in a manner adapting itself in its dimensions to the body movements of the cyclist. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0010" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0010&rsqb;</number> Owing to the application of an insert, which is soft as it is composed of a base layer made from expanded material, and covered by a fabric, elastic in all directions, perfect adaptation of the insert to the body movements of the cyclist is obtained in such a manner that no relative movement occurs between the skin of the cyclist and the surface of the insert, which could cause friction and thus result in abrasion of the skin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0011" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0011&rsqb;</number> Before beginning the description of various preferred examples of realization of the present invention, two general aspects thereof are to be clarified more precisely, namely: </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0012" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0012&rsqb;</number> The present invention does not concern the actual shape of the insert to be inserted in the appropriate zone of the seat of the trousers. The insert thus can present a shape similar to the one provided in the above-mentioned EP-0776615-A2, and can also be of any other shape deemed advantageous. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="2"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> The term &ldquo;fabric elastic in all directions&rdquo; herein is understood, in a general sense, to designate a two-dimensional textile aggregate of fiber threads made from natural or synthetic fibers and/or continuous filaments intertwined in such a manner that an elasticity of the fabric is ensured, which essentially is homogeneous in all directions, i.e. in any direction it is subject to tensile tension. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> According to an aspect of the invention, trousers for use by cyclists include an insert for protecting cyclist body zones resting against one of a bicycle seat or a saddle, the insert comprising one single piece of material fastened at its borders to a fabric of the trousers, e.g., by way of stitching. The insert comprises a base layer made of expandable material, the base layer having a side adapted to be in direct contact with a body of a cyclist. An elastic fabric, elastic in all directions, is fastened onto the side of the base layer, wherein the elastic fabric adapts itself in its dimensions to the movements of a body of a cyclist. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> According to another aspect of the invention, the base layer may be made from foam rubber. The elastic fabric may comprise a fabric made with elastomer fibers with an elastic elongation capacity of more than 5%. The base layer may comprise a soft expandable material. The soft expandable material, in its load-free relaxed state, may be of a thickness (h) ranging from approximately 1 mm to approximately 8 mm and preferably from approximately 3 mm to approximately 5 mm. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PRESENT INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0027" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0027&rsqb;</number> The particulars shown herein are by way of example and for purposes of illustrative discussion of the embodiments of the present invention only and are presented in the cause of providing what is believed to be the most useful and readily understood description of the principles and conceptual aspects of the present invention. In this regard, no attempt is made to show structural details of the present invention in more detail than is necessary for the fundamental understanding of the present invention, the description taken with the drawings making apparent to those skilled in the art how the several forms of the present invention may be embodied in practice. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0028" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0028&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> illustrates a portion of trousers for cyclists, designated <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>, and more precisely the portion corresponding to the groin zone, the person wearing the trousers standing on the ground. An insert, designated <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight>, made from a single piece is fixed at its borders <highlight><bold>3</bold></highlight> (better visible in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>) to the fabric of the trousers <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight> for cyclists by a stitching seam. The seam <highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> is indicated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> by a zigzag line. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0029" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0029&rsqb;</number> The shape of the insert, which as such is not an object of the present invention, can be e.g. pear-shaped, as indicated in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, where the larger portion of the pear outline coincides, after being put on by the cyclist, with the anterior zone of the body, i.e. the zone of the sexual organs, which are particularly susceptible to mechanical stress, and thus merit effective protection. As underlined above, the pear shape of the insert <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is not, however, necessary within the scope of the present invention, which can advantageously be applied also to inserts of other shapes, depending on the requirements and keeping the gender of the user in mind. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0030" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0030&rsqb;</number> For a better understanding of the present invention, <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> will now be referred to, in which a cross-section along the line A-A according to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference> is shown. From <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> it can be seen how the insert <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> is composed of a base layer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> of expanded soft material onto which, on the side directly contacting the body of the cyclist, a fabric <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, elastic in all directions, according to the definition given above concerning the concept of elasticity, is fastened or attached. Owing to the isotropic or homogeneous elasticity of the material covering the insert, the latter can adapt its dimensions to the movements of the body of the cyclist, and thus permits realization of the objective stated above for the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0031" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0031&rsqb;</number> According to a first variant of realization of the present invention, the base layer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> of expanded material consists of foam rubber: the advantage of this solution being mainly the price of this material, as the so-called foam rubber is a low-price material available practically everywhere. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0032" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0032&rsqb;</number> According to a further variant of realization of the present invention, the fabric <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight>, elastic in all directions, is a fabric incorporating elastomer fibers, such as a fiber called Elasthan, marketed under the Lycra trademark of the Du Pont de Nemurs Corp. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0033" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0033&rsqb;</number> It is important however, within the scope of the present invention, that the elastomer fiber present a capacity of elongation of more than 5%. This indication intends to exclude from the field of application of the present invention all fibrous materials the elastic elongation of which is lower than 5% of their length in the absence of tensile tension. It is clear that every material has its specific coefficient of elasticity (called elasticity modulus), but within the frame of the present invention preferentially materials are to be chosen, which present a certain elasticity, as indicated in this specific preferred form of realization of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0034" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0034&rsqb;</number> According to another preferred form of realization of the present invention, aimed at ensuring maximum comfort to the user of the trousers, the base layer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> of expanded material present, in its state free of load, i.e. not subject to any compressing effect, is to be of a thickness h (compare the <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference>) ranging from approximately 3 mm to approximately 5 mm. Experience has shown that these dimensions represent the limits of the thickness h ensuring optimum wearing comfort of the trousers while meeting the objectives of the present invention, and at the same time ensuring the required stability of the cyclist in the saddle. It is known (compare also the statements in this respect in the above-mentioned EP-0776615-A2) that good stability of the cyclist seated on the saddle represents a most important security aspect for the cyclist, and such stability&mdash;also called anchoring&mdash;requires that the support of the cyclist on the saddle not be excessively soft. Thus, there are limits to the softness of the insert, which should not be exceeded. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0035" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0035&rsqb;</number> There are several possibilities of fastening or attaching the fabric <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> to the base layer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> of expanded material, each of which presents its specific advantages and can constitute, according to the specific production facilities, the number of items to be produced, the materials applied, etc., particularly convenient solutions. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0036" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0036&rsqb;</number> Thus, for relatively modest production runs it might prove economically feasible to realize fixation or attachment between the fabric <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> and the layer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> of expanded material by way of adhesive fixation using an elastic adhesive, which in its fixed state after application, remains elastic, such as e.g. a contact adhesive. This type of fixation can also be performed in a craftsman-type workshop and thus is feasible for small production runs for limited series of trousers for cyclists. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0037" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0037&rsqb;</number> Another solution, for larger production runs, is the one shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>, indicating the manner in which the fabric <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is fastened to the base layer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> of expanded material by stitch bonding, applying seams. In <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference> the seam or stitching threads, designated by reference number <highlight><bold>7</bold></highlight>, bind the layer of elastic fabric <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> onto the base layer below. The production of such stitch bonding items is known in practical application and is applied on large surfaces using continuously operating machines, called stitch bonding machines (usually of the Arachne or the Mali type) machines, producing endless tapes of widths of up to several meters at high speed. In such cases the inserts <highlight><bold>2</bold></highlight> must be stamped from the tape of material using suitably shaped templates. For ensuring the desired elasticity of the inserts obtained, as required according to the present invention, it may prove advantageous for the stitching thread to contain elastomer fibers. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0038" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0038&rsqb;</number> According to another preferred form of realization of the present invention, feasible for very large production runs and applicable only under certain conditions, concerning the heat properties of the materials being processed, it provides that the fabric <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> be fastened to the base layer <highlight><bold>5</bold></highlight> of expanded material by way of heat vulcanization. Also, this production method permits production of inserts suitable for meeting the objectives of the present invention, being provided with the required mechanical properties, at much reduced cost and in great quantities. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0039" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0039&rsqb;</number> According to a further preferred form of realization of the present invention, the fabric <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is a woven fabric in which the weft threads as well as the warp threads are produced using elastomer fibers. The advantages of weaving in, producing large flat plane textile surfaces are well known. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0040" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0040&rsqb;</number> According to another variant, better suited for manufacturing small surfaces of elastic fabric <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> of high elasticity, the fabric <highlight><bold>6</bold></highlight> is knitted from a thread produced with elastomer fibers. This solution, benefiting of the known properties of knitted fabrics, permits obtaining fabrics of the highest degree of elasticity in all directions and thus is particularly suited for realizing this form of the present invention. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0041" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0041&rsqb;</number> The present invention has been described here merely in the sense of examples of application in trousers for cyclists, and more specifically in the zones subject to the danger of abrasion of the skin of the wearer. It is evident that the same solution can be adopted for other applications in connection with the practice of sports other than cycling, where the same abrasion problems of the skin of the athlete persist. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0042" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0042&rsqb;</number> It is noted that the foregoing examples have been provided merely for the purpose of explanation and are in no way to be construed as limiting of the present invention. While the present invention has been described with reference to an exemplary embodiment, it is understood that the words which have been used herein are words of description and illustration, rather than words of limitation. Changes may be made, within the purview of the appended claims, as presently stated and as amended, without departing from the scope and spirit of the present invention in its aspects. Although the present invention has been described herein with reference to particular means, materials and embodiments, the present invention is not intended to be limited to the particulars disclosed herein; rather, the present invention extends to all functionally equivalent structures, methods and uses, such as are within the scope of the appended claims. </paragraph>

<subdoc-abstract>
<paragraph id="A-0001" lvl="0">A glove for wearing on a user&apos;s hand to grip an object, such as a barbell. The glove has a palm side which carries a plurality of pads that have gripping surfaces. The pads are positioned in spaced-apart relationship and connected together by a flexible connecting layer. The connecting layer is sufficiently thinner than the pads to allow the glove and user&apos;s hand to be comfortably curled about and uncurled from a object while enabling a secure grip. Valleys between the pads serve to recess the connecting layer below the gripping surfaces. </paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0002" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0002&rsqb;</number> 1. Field of the Invention </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0003" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0003&rsqb;</number> This invention relates in general to gloves for use in sports and other activities in which a person grips an object, and more particularly to gloves for enabling a person to grip and securly hold an object such as a weighlifting barbell, oar or paddle for a boat, baseball bat, skateboard, golf club, javelin, trapeze or gymnastic bar and the like. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0004" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0004&rsqb;</number> 2. Description of the Related Art </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0005" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0005&rsqb;</number> Heretofore, people involved in activities where grip on an object is important, such as weightlifting, baseball, golf, skateboarding, paddling, gymnastics and the like, use gloves to protect their hands and improve traction with the object. Certain types of these prior gloves have palm portions which are designed to improve the grip and prevent slippage. Gloves with palm portions which are padded have been provided, but the padding can make it difficult for the person to easily and comfortably close and maintain a firm grip about the object. In prior gloves which have sufficient padding for protecting the user&apos;s hands, the palm portion tends to bunch up as the hands curl about the object. This undesirably reduces the amount of traction between the glove and object. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0006" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0006&rsqb;</number> The need has therefore been recognized for a glove for use in gripping objects such as barbells which obviates the foregoing and other limitations and disadvantages of prior art gloves. Despite the various gloves in the prior art, there has heretofore not been provided a suitable and attractive solution to these problems.</paragraph>

<heading lvl="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </heading>
<paragraph id="P-0013" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0013&rsqb;</number> <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</cross-reference> in the drawing shows generally at <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> a sports glove in accordance with one preferred embodiment of the invention. Glove <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> is comprised of a glove body <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> having a palm side comprising a palm portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight> which includes finger stall portion <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> and thumb stall <highlight><bold>20</bold></highlight>. The glove further comprises a back side <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight> (shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</cross-reference>). As desired, an elongated strap <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> (only the proximal end is shown) could be attached at its proximal end to the glove body with suitable releasable attachment means (for example, Velcro&reg; fasteners) on the strap&apos;s distal end. In use for sports such as weightlifting or skateboarding, strap <highlight><bold>22</bold></highlight> would be tightly wrapped around the athlete&apos;s wrist to protect against hyperflexion of the wrist. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0014" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0014&rsqb;</number> Glove body <highlight><bold>12</bold></highlight> is comprised of a connecting layer <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> integral with a plurality of gripping pads <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight>, an intermediate layer <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> and an optional inner lining <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>. Intermediate layer <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, best shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>, is comprised of a suitable strong and flexible material such as leather. This layer <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> has an inside <highlight><bold>27</bold></highlight> which faces the hand when the glove is worn, and an outside <highlight><bold>28</bold></highlight> which faces away from the hand. Inner lining <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight> is comprised of a thin fabric material, such as polyester, which is secured as by sewing or laminating to the inside of layer <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>. This inner lining is in contact with the user&apos;s hand. It provides comfort for the hand and also serves to wick any moisture away from the skin. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0015" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0015&rsqb;</number> Finger stall portion <highlight><bold>18</bold></highlight> comprises four stalls: an index finger stall <highlight><bold>29</bold></highlight>, middle finger stall <highlight><bold>30</bold></highlight>, ring finger stall <highlight><bold>32</bold></highlight> and little finger stall <highlight><bold>34</bold></highlight>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0016" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0016&rsqb;</number> Gripping pads <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> are carried on palm portion <highlight><bold>14</bold></highlight>, including the finger and thumb stalls, on their sides facing away from back side <highlight><bold>16</bold></highlight>. The pads are raised above the connecting layer and are formed with substantially flat lands <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> which provide traction or gripping surfaces. In the drawing figures, the pads on the palm portion are labelled <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a </italic></highlight>through <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d, </italic></highlight>those on the finger stalls are labelled <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e </italic></highlight>through <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>h </italic></highlight>and those on the thumb stall are labelled <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>i </italic></highlight>through <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>k. </italic></highlight></paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0017" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0017&rsqb;</number> The pads and connecting layer preferably are integrally formed of the same material. To this end, the connecting layer including the pads can be molded together from a suitable elastomer, such as rubber, which is flexible while providing optimum traction contact with the object being gripped. The connecting layer has a thickness which is sufficiently thinner than the pad thicknesses to enable the pads to bend toward and away from one another as the user curls and uncurls, respectively, the glove. For this purpose, a pad thickness in the range of 2 mm to 5 mm and a connecting layer thickness in the range of 0.8 mm to 2 mm can be employed. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0018" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0018&rsqb;</number> The gripping pads <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and connecting layer <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> can be molded by suitable processes such as injection or compression molding. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0019" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0019&rsqb;</number> The palm portion as well as the finger and thumb stalls further comprise a stitching layer <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> which is formed with openings or windows <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> through which the gripping pads project. Layer <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is also shaped to repose in valleys <highlight><bold>44</bold></highlight> which are formed between lands <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> of the gripping pads, as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>.. Individual ones of the openings <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> are commensurate in size and shape with the respective pads which they surround. Windows <highlight><bold>48</bold></highlight> can advantageously be formed by die cutting. Stitching layer <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> is formed of a suitable flexible material, such as leather, which is sufficiently strong to receive and hold stitches <highlight><bold>50</bold></highlight> (<cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</cross-reference>). Layer <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> enables the stitches to penetrate through the connecting layer and into intermediate layer <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> to securely anchor these components together. This construction also enables sewing below the pad surfaces so that the stitches are protected from objectionable abrasion, such as knurling on the object. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0020" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0020&rsqb;</number> For purposes of clarity in the explanation, in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</cross-reference> portions of intermediate layer <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight>, inner inner <highlight><bold>26</bold></highlight>, pad <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> and stitching layer <highlight><bold>46</bold></highlight> are show partially cut-away and peeled back from the glove body. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0021" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0021&rsqb;</number> Gripping pads <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> in combination with connecting layer <highlight><bold>42</bold></highlight> provide a &ldquo;living hinge&rdquo; action. This action is a result of the flexibility of the connecting layer together with the spacing provided by lands <highlight><bold>40</bold></highlight> and the relative size, shape and positioning of the pads. The living hinge enables the pads to lie spaced-apart when the glove is uncurled as shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</cross-reference>A, and then to pivot together in the manner of a hinge as the glove is curled to the configuration shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</cross-reference>. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0022" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0022&rsqb;</number> The gripping pads <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight> are sized, shaped and positioned such that each pad essentially is an extension of the part of the human hand which it overlies. Thus, the pads <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>a</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>d </italic></highlight>in the glove palm portion are sized and shaped substantially commensurate with the corresponding fleshier parts of the human palm. The sizing, shaping and positioning also are such that the lands between the pads run along and essentially conform with and mimic the creases of the human palm (which act as hinges for portions of the human palm). The pads <highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>e</italic></highlight>-<highlight><bold>38</bold></highlight><highlight><italic>h </italic></highlight>on the finger stalls and the lands which separate them, as well as the pads and lands for the thumb stall, are also sized, shaped and positioned substantially commensurate with the corresponding portions of the human fingers and thumb. As a result, when the glove palm is curled or uncurled then each of the pads, enabled by the glove&apos;s living hinge action, pivot with the underlying curling or uncurling portion of the person&apos;s hand, fingers and thumb. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0023" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0023&rsqb;</number> When a person wearing one or a pair of the sports glove <highlight><bold>10</bold></highlight> flexes his or her hands or grips an object, the living hinge action enables the pads to form a relatively large traction area with an almost continuous gripping surface around the object <highlight><bold>52</bold></highlight>, shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</cross-reference> as a barbell. This enhances the gripping effect between the glove and object. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0024" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0024&rsqb;</number> Another embodiment of the invention provides a glove similar to the embodiment of FIGS. <highlight><bold>1</bold></highlight>-<highlight><bold>4</bold></highlight> and in which the palm and finger/thumb stalls are pre-curved. The glove can be pre-curved by making the connecting layer <highlight><bold>23</bold></highlight> on the glove&apos;s back side longer than intermediate layer <highlight><bold>25</bold></highlight> on the palm side, and then attaching suitable gussets (not shown) which are positioned to urge the glove into a cylindrically curved shape for gripping an object. The gussets could be comprised of pieces of triangular-shaped fabric. </paragraph>
<paragraph id="P-0025" lvl="0"><number>&lsqb;0025&rsqb;</number> A further embodiment of the invention shown in <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</cross-reference> provides a glove body similar to <cross-reference target="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</cross-reference> but with a more flexible connecting layer <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> which is integral with and holding pads <highlight><bold>56</bold></highlight> apart. Layer <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is supported on an intermediate layer <highlight><bold>58</bold></highlight> and optional inner layer <highlight><bold>60</bold></highlight>. Connecting layer <highlight><bold>54</bold></highlight> is made with a thickness thinner than 0.8 mm to provide greater flexibility for enabling the curling action. The connecting layer and pads are strengthened by laminating or embedding or otherwise substantally integrating a suitable scrim or mesh fabric <highlight><bold>62</bold></highlight> into the elastomer which forms the connecting layer and pads during the molding process. </paragraph>
